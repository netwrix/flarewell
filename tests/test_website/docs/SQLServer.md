# Requirements for SQL Server to Store Audit Data

If you plan to generate reports, use alerts and run search queries in Netwrix Auditor, consider that your deployment must include Microsoft SQL Server where audit data will be stored. For report generation, Reporting Services (or Advanced Services) are also required.

Supported SQL Server versions and editions are listed below.

Due to limited database size, Express Edition (with Reporting Services) is recommended only for evaluation, PoC or small environments. For production environment, consider using Standard or Enterprise Edition.

| Version | Edition |
| --- | --- |
| SQl Server 2022 | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=104781` "Express Edition") with [Reporting Services](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=104502` "Reporting Services") (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |
| SQL Server 2019 (on-premises Windows version) cumulative update 10 and above | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition](`https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866658` "Express Edition") with [Reporting Services](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100122` "Reporting Services") (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |
| SQL Server 2017 | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition](`https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866658` "Express Edition") with [Reporting Services](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=100122` "Reporting Services") (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |
| SQL Server 2016 | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition with Advanced Services (SP2)](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56840` "Express Edition with Advanced Services (SP2)")   (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |
| SQL Server 2014 | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition with Advanced Services](`https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42299` "Express Edition with Advanced Services (SP2)")   (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |
| SQL Server 2012 | * Standard or Enterprise Edition * [Express Edition with Advanced Services](`http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062`)   (for evaluation, PoC and small environments) |

**NOTE:** SQL express is only supported for small environments. It might cause performance issues on the medium and large environments.

SQL Server [AlwaysOn Availability Group](`https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server` "AlwaysOn Availability Group") can also be used for hosting Netwrix Auditor audit databases. For that, after specifying audit database settings in Netwrix Auditor, you should manually add created database to a properly configured AlwaysOn Availability Group. These steps must be taken each time a new audit database is created in Netwrix Auditor.

See the [Add a database to an Always On availability group with the 'Availability Group Wizard'](`https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-database-to-group-wizard` "Add a database to an Always On availability group with the 'Availability Group Wizard'") Microsoft article for details on adding a database to AlwaysOn Availability Group.

You can configure Netwrix Auditor to use an existing SQL Server instance, or deploy a new instance.

If your deployment planning reveals that SQL Server Express Edition will be suitable for your production environment, then you can install, for example, SQL Server 2016 SP2 Express with Advanced Services using the Audit Database Settings wizard or by manually downloading it from Microsoft web site. See the [Install Microsoft SQL Server and Reporting Services](#Install "Install Microsoft SQL Server and Reporting Services") section for additional information.

## SQL Server and Databases

Netwrix Auditor uses SQL Server databases as operational storages that keep audit data for analysis, search and reporting purposes. Supported versions are SQL Server 2012 and later (Reporting Services versions should be 2012 R2 or later).

* You will be prompted to configure the default SQL Server instance when you create the first monitoring plan; also, you can specify it Netwrix Auditor settings.
* You can configure Netwrix Auditor to use an existing instance of SQL Server, or deploy a new instance, as described in the [Create a New Monitoring Plan](../Admin/MonitoringPlans/Create.htm "Create a New Plan") topic.

For evaluation and PoC projects you can deploy Microsoft SQL Server 2016 SP2 Express Edition with Advanced Services (sufficient for report generation).

For production deployment in bigger environments, it is recommended to use Microsoft SQL Server Standard Edition or higher because of the limited database size and other limitations of Express Edition.

Make your choice based on the size of the environment you are going to monitor, the number of users and other factors. This refers, for example, to Netwrix Auditor for Network Devices: if you need to audit successful logons to these devices, consider that large number of activity records will be produced, so plan for SQL Server Standard or Enterprise edition (Express edition will not fit).

Netwrix Auditor supports automated size calculation for all its databases in total, displaying the result, in particular, in the [Database Statistics](../Admin/HealthStatus/Dashboard/DatabaseStatistics.htm "Database Statistics") of the Health Status dashboard. This feature, however, is supported only for SQL Server 2012 SP3 and later.

### Databases

To store data from the data sources included in the monitoring plan, the Monitoring Plan Wizard creates an Audit Database. Default database name is *Netwrix_Auditor_\*.

It is strongly recommended to target each monitoring plan at a separate database.

Also, several dedicated databases are created automatically on the default SQL Server instance. These databases are intended for storing various data, as listed below.

| Database name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Netwrix_AlertsDB | Stores alerts. |
| Netwrix_Auditor_API | Stores activity records collected using Integration API. |
| Netwrix_Auditor_EventLog | Stores internal event records. |
| **Netwrix_CategoriesDB** | Intended for integration with Netwrix Data Classification.  This database is always created but is involved in the workflow only if the DDC Provider is enabled. See for more information. |
| Netwrix_CommonDB | Stores views to provide cross-database reporting. |
| Netwrix_ImportDB | Stores data imported from Long-Term Archive. |
| **Netwrix_OverviewReportsDB** | Stores data required for overview reports. |
| **Netwrix_Self_Audit** | Stores data collected by Netwrix Auditor self-audit  (optional, created if the corresponding feature is enabled). |

These databases usually do not appear in the UI; they are only listed in the **Database statistics** widget of the **Health Status** dashboard. If you need their settings to be modified via SQL Server Management Studio, please contact your database administrator. For example, you may need to change logging and recovery model (by default, it is set to **simple** for all these databases, as well as for the Audit databases).

## Install Microsoft SQL Server and Reporting Services

Netwrix Auditor uses Microsoft SQL Server database as short-term data storage and utilizes SQL Server Reporting Services engine for report generation. You can either use your existing SQL Server for these purposes, or deploy a new server instance. System requirements for SQL Server are listed in the corresponding section of this guide.

Consider the following:

* Supported versions are 2012 and later.
* **NOTE:** Please, note that for the Reporting Services, only English operating systems are supported.
* Supported editions are Enterprise, Standard and Express with Advanced Services (it includes Reporting Services).
* If downloading SQL Server Express Edition with Advanced Services from Microsoft site, make sure you download the file whose name contains SQLEXPRADV. Otherwise, Reporting Services will not be deployed, and you will not be able to analyze and report on collected data.

By the way of example, this section provides instructions on how to:

* [SQL Server Reporting Services](SQLServerReportingService.htm "SQL Server Reporting Services")

For detailed information on installing other versions/editions, refer to Microsoft website.

Maximum database size provided in SQL Server Express editions may be insufficient for storing data in bigger infrastructures. Thus, when planning for SQL Server, consider maximum database capacity in different editions, considering the size of the audited environment.

## SQL Server

When planning for SQL Server that will host Auditor databases, consider the following:

* For PoC, evaluation scenario or small environment SQL Server can run on the same computer where Netwrix Auditor Server will be installed, or on the remote machine accessible by Netwrix Auditor. Remember to check connection settings and access rights.
* In large and extra-large infrastructures SQL Server should be installed on a separate server or cluster. Installation of Netwrix Auditor and SQL Server on the same server is not recommended in such environments.
* If you plan to have Netwrix Auditor and SQL Server running on different machines, establish fast and reliable connection between them (100 Mbps or higher).
* Both standalone servers and SQL Server clusters are supported, as well as AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
* You can configure Netwrix Auditor to use an existing SQL Server instance, or create a new one. As an option, you can install SQL Server 2016 Express Edition, using the Audit Database Settings wizard or manually downloading it from Microsoft web site (see [Install Microsoft SQL Server and Reporting Services](#Install "Install Microsoft SQL Server and Reporting Services")).

**CAUTION:** It is not recommended to install Netwrix Auditor databases to a production SQL Server instance. Such instances may have a lot of maintenance plans or scripts running that may affect data uploaded by the product. The product databases are designed for reporting and searching and do not require maintenance or backup. For the long-term data storage, Netwrix Auditor uses Long-Term Archive. See [File-Based Repository for Long-Term Archive](LongTermArchive.htm "File-Based Repository for Long-Term Archive") for additional information.

If you select to set up a new SQL Server instance, the current user account (this should be a member of local Administrators group) will be assigned the *sysadmin* server role for it.

You will also need to provide a path for storing the SQL Server databases - it is recommended to specify the data drive for that purpose (by default, system drive is used).

* If you plan to have more than one Netwrix Auditor Servers in your network, make sure to configure them to use different SQL Server instances. The same SQL Server instance cannot be used to store audit data collected by several Netwrix Auditor Servers.
* Consider that sufficient access rights will be required for the account that will write data to the audit databases hosted on the default SQL Server. This account should be assigned the following roles:
  1. **Database owner (db_owner)** database-level role
  2. dbcreator server-level role

  This account can be specified when you configure the [Audit Database](../Admin/Settings/AuditDatabase.htm "Audit Database") settings.

## Database Sizing

For database sizing, it is recommended to estimate:

* Size of the environment you are going to monitor
* Amount of activity records produced by the audited system
* Retention policy for the audit databases
* Maximum database size supported by different SQL Server versions

To estimate the number of the activity records produced by your data sources, collected and saved by Auditor during the week, you can use the Activity records by date widget of the Health Status dashboard. See the [Activity Records Statistics](../Admin/HealthStatus/Dashboard/ActivityRecordStatistics.htm "Activity Records Statistics") topic for additional information.

Auditor supports automated size calculation for all its databases in total, displaying the result, in particular, in the Database Statistics widget of the Health Status dashboard. To estimate current capacity and daily growth for each database, you can click View details and examine information in the table. See the [Database Statistics](../Admin/HealthStatus/Dashboard/DatabaseStatistics.htm "Database Statistics") topic for additional information.

This feature is supported only for SQL Server 2012 SP3 and later.

Remember that database size in SQL Server Express editions may be insufficient. For example, Microsoft SQL Server 2012 SP3 Express Edition has the following limitations which may affect performance:

* Each instance uses only up to 1 GB of RAM
* Each instance uses only up to 4 cores of the first CPU
* Database size cannot exceed 10 GB

## Database Settings

Settings of the certain Audit database, including hosting SQL Server, can be specified when you create a monitoring plan and configure data collection for an audited system. Consider the following:

* To store data from the data sources included in the monitoring plan, you can configure the Audit database on the default SQL Server (recommended), or select another server.
* By default, database name will be *Netwrix_Auditor_\*; you can name the database as you need, for example, *Active_Directory_Audit_Data*.

To avoid syntax errors, for instance, in the PowerShell cmdlets, it is recommended to use the underscore character (_) instead of space character in the database names.

If not yet existing on the specified SQL server instance, the database will be created there. For this operation to succeed, ensure that Netwrix Auditor service account has sufficient rights on that SQL Server.

Settings of other Auditor databases cannot be modified.

### Example

As a database administrator, you can have SQL Server cluster of 2 servers, and 2 Oracle servers. If so, you can create 2 monitoring plans:

1. First monitoring plan for collecting data from SQL Servers, targeted at *Netwrix_Auditor_SQL_Monitoring* database.
2. Second monitoring plan for collecting data from Oracle servers, targeted at *Netwrix_Auditor_Oracle_Monitoring* database.

### Database Retention

Consider that retention is a global setting, that is, it applies to all Audit databases you configure for your monitoring plans.

Follow the steps to change database retention after the product deployment.

**Step 1 –** In the Auditor main screen, select Settings \> Audit Database.

![](../static/img/Auditor/Images/Auditor/DeploymentPlan/Audit_DB_Settings.png)

**Step 2 –** In the dialog displayed, make sure the Clear stale data when a database retention period is exceeded: is set to ON, then click Modify to specify the required retention period (in days).

This setting also applies to the *Netwrix_Auditor_API* database.

## Configure Audit Database Account

This is the account that Auditor uses to write the collected audit data to the audit databases. Starting with version 9.96, you can use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for that purpose.

*Remember,* gMSA cannot be used to access SSRS. Use a standard account for that. See the [SQL Server Reporting Services](SQLServerReportingService.htm "Configure SSRS Account") topic for additional information.

This account must be granted the **Database owner (db_owner)** role and the **dbcreator** server role on the SQL Server instance hosting your audit databases.

Follow the steps to assign the **dbcreator** and **db_owner** roles.

**Step 3 –** On the computer where SQL Server instance with the Audit Database resides, navigate to **Start** \> **All Programs** \> **Microsoft SQL Server** \> **SQL Server Management Studio**.

**Step 4 –** Connect to the server.

**Step 5 –** In the left pane, expand the **Security** node. Right-click the **Logins** node and select **New Login** from the pop-up menu.

![](../static/img/Auditor/Images/Auditor/ManualConfig/ManualConfig_SSMS_NewLogin2016.png)

**Step 6 –** Click **Search** next to **Login Name** and specify the user that you want to assign the **db_owner** role to.

**Step 7 –** Select **Server roles** on the left and assign the **dbcreator** role to the new login.

**Step 8 –** Select the **User Mapping** tab. Select all databases used by Auditor to store audit data in the upper pane and check **db_owner** in the lower pane.

**NOTE:** This step is only required when changing the existing Audit Database Account to a new one.

**Step 9 –**  If the account that you want to assign the **db_owner** role to has been already added to **SQL Server Logins**, expand the **Security** \> **Logins** node, right-click the account, select **Properties** from the pop-up menu, and edit its roles.
