## Installation and Initial Scan

Once you install Platform Governance for NetSuite, you simply click the **Start Spider** button and your customizations are documented over the course of 4-5 days with minimal impact on system performance. Once completed, you have a searchable database of all your customizations.

### Clean Up

Use the end to end documentation of custom objects and our Clean Up Tools to:

* Identify unused fields, searches and other custom objects.

* Use Change Requests to keep your changes organized and capture approvals.

### Script Management

Critical Script Analysis enables you to determine how healthy your scripts are and what areas you can fix to improve your account. With our tools and the Critical Script Analysis methodology you can:

* Identify high priority scripts based on usage.
* Identify people and departments triggering scripts to focus on scripts that could be inappropriately triggered.
* Understand script execution times.

### Environment Comparison

The Environment Management Module enables NetSuite customers and consultants to quickly and accurately identify differences between any two NetSuite accounts that havePlatform Governance for NetSuite Intelligent Change Management installed.

1. Sandbox Refreshes
2. Migrating Customizations Between Developer and Sandbox Accounts
3. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Performance Testing Environment Validation
4. Deploying Changes to Production
