| --- | --- |
| Oracle Database 19c (Unified Auditing) | `select ENTITY_NAME, ENABLED_OPTION, SUCCESS, FAILURE from AUDIT_UNIFIED_ENABLED_POLICIES;` |
| Oracle Database 12c, 18c, 19c (Unified Auditing) | `select USER_NAME, ENABLED_OPT, SUCCESS, FAILURE from AUDIT_UNIFIED_ENABLED_POLICIES;` |
| Oracle Database Enterprise Edition  (Fine Grained Auditing) | `SELECT POLICY_NAME, ENABLED from DBA_AUDIT_POLICIES;` |
| Oracle Database 11g(Standard Auditing)  Starting with version 10.5, Netwrix Auditor provides limited support of Oracle Database 11g and trail auditing mode accordingly. | `SELECT audit_option, success, failure FROM dba_stmt_audit_opts;`  To review your initialization parameters, execute the following command:  `SHOW PARAMETERS audit%r;` |
