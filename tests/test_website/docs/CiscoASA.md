# Configure Cisco ASA Devices

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html` "Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor") knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

* Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
* Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  + On the Cisco ASA Device:

    - The global configuration mode is selected.
    - The `logging enable` option is selected on the Cisco ASA device.
    - The `logging host` parameter is set to the host address of the audited CiscoASA device. And UDP port (for, example 514) is used for sending messages.

      **NOTE:** Do not select the EMBLEM format logging for the syslog server option.
    - The `logging timestamp` option enabled.
    - The `logging trap` option is selected from 1 to 6 inclusive.

To configure your Cisco ASA devices, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Cisco ASA device terminal through the SSH/Telnet connection (for example, use PuTTY Telnet client).
2. Access the global configuration mode. For example:

   hostname# configure terminal

   hostname(config)#
3. Enable logging. For example:

   hostname(config)# logging enable
4. Set the IP address of the computer that hosts Netwrix Auditor Server as the `logging host` parameter. And make sure that the UDP port is used for sending syslog messages (e.g., 514 UDP port). For example:

   hostname(config)# logging host \

   Do not select the EMBLEM format logging for the syslog server option.
5. Enable the `logging timestamp` option. For example:

   hostname(config)# logging timestamp
6. Set the `logging trap` option from 1 to 6 inclusive. For example:

   hostname(config)# logging trap 5
7. Configure the devices to show username for failed logons:

   hostname(config)# no logging hide username
