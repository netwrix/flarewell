# Configure Cisco IOS Devices

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html` "Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor") knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

* Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
* Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  + The global configuration mode is selected.
  + The `logging timestamp` option enabled.
  + The `logging trap` option is selected from 1 to 6 inclusive.
  + The `logging host` parameter is set to the host address where the service is going to be installed. And UDP port (for, example 514) is used for sending messages.

To configure your Cisco IOS devices, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Cisco IOS device terminal through the SSH/Telnet connection (for example, use PuTTY Telnet client).
2. Access the global configuration mode. For example:

   Router# configure terminal
3. Enable time stamps in syslog messages:

   Router# service timestamps log datetime localtime show-timezone
4. Set the `logging trap` option from 1 to 6 inclusive. For example:

   Router# logging trap 5
5. Set the IP address of the Netwrix Auditor Server as the logging host parameter. And make sure that the UDP port is used for sending syslog messages (e.g., 514 UDP port). For example:

   Router# logging 192.168.1.5
