# Health Summary Email

Auditor Health Summary email includes all statistics on the product operations and health for the last 24 hours; it also notifies you about license status. By default, this email is generated daily at 7:00 AM and delivered to the recipient specified in the [Notifications](../Settings/Notifications.htm "Notifications") settings. Email content is very similar to data presented in the [Health Status Dashboard](Dashboard/Overview.htm "Health Status Dashboard").

For greater usability, to depict overall product health state, the email includes a color indicator in the topmost section: green means Auditor had no issues while auditing your ITÂ infrastructure, and red means there were some problems that require your attention.

The email looks like shown below:

The Monitoring Overview section of the email provides detail information only for the monitoring plans with issues. Successfully completed monitoring plans are not included.
