# What's New

## New Netwrix Community!

All Netwrix product announcements have moved to the new Netwrix Community. See announcements for Netwrix Auditor in the [Auditor](`https://community.netwrix.com/c/auditor/announcements/90` "`https://community.netwrix.com/c/auditor/announcements/90"`) area of our new community.

The following information highlights the new and enhanced features introduced in this Netwrix Auditor 10.7 version.

## New Features

Integration with Netwrix Privilege Secure

Netwrix Auditor is able to store its collection credentials in Netwrix Privilege Secure, making the usage of Auditor more secure.

Data sensitivity tags in searches and alerts for NetApp, Qumulo, and Synology

Data sensitivity tags in searches and alerts enable customers using NetApp, Qumulo, and Synology systems to reduce the time to detect incidents involving sensitive data and accelerate the response to these kinds of threats. They can set up alerts that will be triggered whenever sensitive documents are accessed, modified or deleted, or filter out all activity that isnâ€™t related to sensitive data.

New sensitive data-related risks for SharePoint Online

Three new risks help users secure their overexposed sensitive data in SharePoint Online (NDC is required). The new risks include:

* Sensitive files shared with anonymous users
* Sensitive files shared with external users
* Sensitive documents accessible by everyone

New Exchange Online report to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive email communications

This new state-in-time report shows all Exchange Online mailboxes with forwarding enabled, including details on whether the recipient is an internal or external user. Customers can use this report to review forwarding rules, detect Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, and mitigate the risk of ongoing data leakages.

More informative subject lines in email notifications

The subject line of email alerts may include the who, what, or where details of an alerted activity. For example, the subject line of an email alert will be "*J.Doe has added M.Smith to Domain Admins*" instead of "*User has been added to a privileged group*".

## Major Enhancements

* Download and read actions in SharePoint Online reports can be easily differentiated.
* Configuration of government Microsoft 365 tenants became easier. In the UI you can choose the national cloud environment you want to use.
* Modern authentication options for email notifications are supported.
* Option to save and send a report at the same time.
* Support for various new network devices, NAS, and database versions.

Numerous additional enhancements have been made to improve administration, performance, and security.
