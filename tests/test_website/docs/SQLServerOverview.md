# SQL Server State-In-Time Reports

These are reports on the SQL Server state-in-time data, including roles, permissions and other configuration settings:

* [Account Permissions in SQL

* [Object Permissions in SQL
  Server](SQLObjectPermissions.htm "Object Permissions in SQL Server")
* [SQL Server Databases](SQLDatabases.htm "SQL Server Databases")
* [SQL Server Means Granted](SQLMeansGranted.htm "SQL Server Means Granted")

To instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect data needed for these reports, make sure that **Collect data for state-in-time reports** option is selected in the corresponding monitoring plan properties. See theÂ [Settings for Data Collection](../../../MonitoringPlans/Create.htm#Settings "Settings for Data Collection") topic for additional information. By default, data collection will run daily at 4 AM.
