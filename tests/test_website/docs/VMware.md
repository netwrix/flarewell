# VMware State-In-Time Reports

These are reports on the VMware vCenter state-in-time data, including account permissions and object permissions:

* [Account Permissions in vCenter](#Account "Account Permissions in SQL Server")
* [Detailed Account Permissions in vCenter](#Detailed "Detailed Account Permissions in vCenter")
* [Object Permissions in vCenter](#Object "Object Permissions in vCenter")

To instruct Netwrix Auditor to collect data needed for these reports, make sure that **Collect data for state-in-time reports** option is selected in the corresponding monitoring plan properties. See the [Settings for Data Collection](../../../MonitoringPlans/Create.htm#Settings "Settings for Data Collection") topic for more information.

## Account Permissions in vCenter

Shows vCenter objects that user or group has explicit or inherited permissions on (either granted directly or through group membership). Use this report to see who has permissions to what and prevent rights elevation.

Supported object types and attributes are listed in the [VMware](../../../../Configuration/VMware/Overview.htm "VMware Servers") topic.

For this report to function properly, you must enable the **Collect data for state-in-time reports** option for the data source in the monitoring plan settings. See the [Settings for Data Collection](../../../MonitoringPlans/Create.htm#Settings "Settings for Data Collection") topic for more information.
