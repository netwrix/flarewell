# Inactive User Tracker

Auditor Inactive User Tracker standalone tool discovers inactive user and computer accounts. It performs the following tasks:

* Checks the managed domain or specific organizational units by inquiring all domain controllers, and sends reports to managers and system administrators listing all accounts that have been inactive for the specified number of days.
* Automatically deactivates inactive accounts by settings a random password, disabling, deleting or moving them to a specified organizational unit.

  **NOTE:** The password that is generated will contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. The default value for the password length is 15 characters. You can modify this password any time by configuring registry keys. See the [Registry Keys](#Registry "Registry Keys") topic for additional information.

## Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying data that you want to exclude from the Inactive User monitoring scope.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the Inactive Users monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the `%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Inactive Users Tracker` folder.

**NOTE:** This is default location. However, it may be changed because users can move this folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

* Each entry must be a separate line.
* A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
* Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

| File | Description | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filter.txt | Contains a list of accounts to be excluded from processing. | `Username` |
| omitdclist.txt | Contains a list of domain controllers to be excluded from processing.  Auditor skips all automated deactivation actions for inactive accounts (disable, move, delete) even if one domain controller is unavailable during scheduled task execution. Add the unavailable domain controllers to this file to ensure Auditor functions properly. | `Full DNS name` or `NetBIOS name`  IP addresses are not supported. |
| omitoulist.txt | Contains a list of organizational units to be excluded from processing. | `Path`  `*OU=OUNAME*`  For example:  If the OU is  "sampledomain.sample/sampling", the syntax should be:  `*OU=sampling*` |
