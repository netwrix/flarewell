# Custom Search-Based Reports

Netwrix Auditor allows you to save your favorite searches as reports to access them instantly. For your convenience, the product provides predefined templates for some popular usage scenarios. You can save your custom report or use one of the templates provided by Netwrix. Navigate to Reports → Custom to review these reports. Click View to generate the selected report.

Moreover, custom reports are shared between all Netwrix Auditor clients that have access to the same Netwrix Auditor Server (the main component responsible for collecting and processing audit data).

For your convenience, you can create additional folders for your custom reports. Select Add Folder under the Custom section and specify the name for a new folder. Then, select a custom report and move it to the new folder.

The example custom report results apply to AD or Group Policy modifications by administrator.
