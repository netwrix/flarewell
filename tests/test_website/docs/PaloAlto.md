# Configure PaloAlto Devices

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html` "Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor") knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

* Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
* Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  + Create a Syslog Server profile and syslog forwarding for the target PaloAlto device via Web Interface as described below.

To configure your PaloAlto devices, create a Syslog server profile and assign it to the log settings for each log type.

Follow the steps to configure a Syslog server profile.

**Step 1 –** Connect to your PaloAlto device: launch an Internet browser and enter the IP address of the firewall in the URL field (`https://).

**Step 2 –** In the Web Interface, navigate to **Device** \> **Server Profiles** \> **Syslog**.

**Step 3 –** Click **Add** and specify profile name, for example, *"SyslogProf1"*.

**Step 4 –** Specify syslog server parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Specify unique name for a syslog server. |
| Syslog Server | Provide a server name by entering its FQDN or IPv4 address. |
| Transport | Select UDP. |
| Port | Provide the name of the UDP port used to listen to network devices (514 port used by default). |
| Format | Select IETF. |
| Facility | Netwrix recommends using default values. |

Follow the steps to configure syslog forwarding.

**Step 1 –** In the Web Interface, navigate to **Device** \> **Log Settings**.

**Step 2 –** For System, Config, and User ID logs, click Add and enter unique name of your syslog server.

**Step 3 –** On the syslog panel, click Add and select the syslog profile you created above.

**Step 4 –** Click **Commit** and review the logs on the syslog server.

**NOTE:** After configuring the monitoring plan, Netwrix Auditor will listen to the logs forwarded by the Palo Alto device.
