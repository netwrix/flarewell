# What is Documented?

There are four outcomes for customizations Platform Governance for NetSuite finds in the system:

* [Captured and Documented](#documented)
* [Partially Documented](#partially_documented)
* [Not Documented](#not_documented)
* [Agent Tracking](#agent_tracking)

## Captured and Documented in the Customization Record

The following critical metadata related to your account customizations is captured:

* Accounting/Setting Lists
* Custom Records and Custom Record Fields
* Custom Fields (for example, Body, Item, Entity, Column, Item Number and Other Field)
* Mass Updates (except for mass update schedule information)
* Saved Searches (fields, criteria, joins with scripts/workflows and formulas)
* Unlocked and Unencrypted Script Records (for example, Client, User Event, Scheduled, Suitelets and Workflow Action)
* Locked Script Records (however related dependencies can not be established)
* NetSuite Preferences (Accounting Preferences, Company Preferences etc.)
* Integrations
* Forms (Entry and Transaction)
* Script Deployments
* Script Library
* SuiteCommerce Advanced folder files and all custom SS, SSP and JS files
* User Permission Overrides
* User Roles
* User Role Assignments
* Workflows

## Partially Documented in the Customization Record

The following NetSuite objects are partially documented. They are not fully documented for one or more of the following reasons:

* Record types do not have a NetSuite API that exposes the full customization data
* Records are standard objects which cannot be changed

| Object | Category | Description | Change Impact | Change Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Report | Other | Custom Reports are documented including the report name, type and the date the report was last modified. | Changing these can impact what data is shown on the report. | Example: Change to Report Layout  - detects the Date Last Modified in the Analytics Audit Log was changed and creates a change log.  - Change Log indicates when the Report was updated.  - You need to look at the Custom Report itself:  1. Open **Customize the Custom Report**  2. Click **More Options**  3. Open **Audit Trail** tab. |
| PDF Template | Other | PDF Templates are document including the template name, type and the date the template was last modified. | Changing these can impact email templates and other areas where PDF templates are used. | TBD |
| Standard Column Field | Standard Objects | Customization records are created only for Standard objects that are in use by scripted objects such as Workflows or Scripts. These are tracked to identify the automation dependencies. | No risk since there is no way to change standard objects in NetSuite. | If a standard object is added to or removed from a customization, a change log will be created for that customization. |
| Standard Report | Standard Objects | Customization records are created only for Standard objects that are in use by scripted objects such as Workflows or Scripts. These are tracked to identify the automation dependencies. | No risk since there is no way to change standard objects in NetSuite. | If a standard object is added to or removed from a customization, a change log will be created for that customization. |
| Standard  Sub List | Standard Objects | Customization records are created only for Standard objects that are in use by scripted objects such as Workflows or Scripts. These are tracked to identify the automation dependencies. | No risk since there is no way to change standard objects in NetSuite. | If a standard object is added to or removed from a customization, a change log will be created for that customization. |

## Not Documented in the Customization Record

These record types do not have a NetSuite API to enable Platform Governance for NetSuite to capture customization data.

| Object | Category | Description | Change Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom Sub List | Other | This is the sublist that is displayed on the form. | Changing this can change what appears on a form. |
| HTML File | Web Related | Files that are part of the web site if the customer is using the Netsuite eCommerce modules, SiteBuilder or SuiteCommerce Advanced. | Changing these can change the pages of the website. |
| Integration | External System/Integration | Information relating to integrations to external systems are not documented. | Changes to objects in NetSuite could impact functionality in other systems. |
| Item/Category Template | Web Related | Applies to companies that use SiteBuilder. | Changing these can change the functionality of the website. |
| JavaScript File | Web Related | These are JavaScript files in the file cabinet that are often used for automation on websites. Applies to customers using Netsuite eCommerce modules, SiteBuilder or SuiteCommerce Advanced. | Changing these can change the functionality of the website. |
| Layout | Web Related | Applies to companies that use SiteBuilder | Changing these can change the functionality of the website. |
| Scorecard  Report | Other | Applies to dashboard objects. | Changing this will change what is displayed on the dashboard. |
| Scriptlet | Deprecated | These object types have been deprecated by NetSuite and are no longer in use. | If still in use, changes to these objects can impact system functionality. |
| Web Tag | Web Related | Applies to companies that use SiteBuilder | Changing these can change the functionality of the website. |
| Web Site | Web Related | The metadata that defines the web site for customers using the Netsuite eCommerce modules, SiteBuilder or SuiteCommerce Advanced. | Changing this can impact website functionality. |

  

## Agent Tracking
