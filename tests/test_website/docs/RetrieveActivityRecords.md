# Retrieve Activity Records

## Endpoint

Use to export data from the Audit Database. By default, first 1,000 Activity Records are returned. To get the next Activity Records, send a POST request to the same endpoint containing a Continuation mark.

| Method | Endpoint | POST Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | ``https://\{host:port\}/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum\{?format=json\}\{&count=Number\}`` | — |
| POST | ``https://\{host:port\}/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum\{?format=json\}\{&count=Number\}`` | [Continuation Mark](PostData/ContinuationMark) |

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host:port` | Yes | Replace with the IP address or a name of your Netwrix Auditor Server host and port (e.g., *172.28.6.15:9699*, *stationwin12:9699*, *WKSWin2012.enterprise.local:9699*).  With enabled HTTPS, provide the computer name as it appears in certificate properties. |
| `format=json` | No | Add this parameter to retrieve data in JSON format. Otherwise, XML-formatted Activity Records will be returned. |
| `count=Number` | No | Add this parameter to define the number of Activity Records to be exported. Replace `Number` with a number (e.g., `&count=1500`). |

Optional parameters (format and count) can be provided in any order. The first parameter must start with ?, others are joined with &, no spaces required (e.g., `?format=json&count=1500`).

## Response

| Request Status | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Success | The HTTP status code in the response header is 200 OK. The response body contains Activity Records and Continuation Mark.   |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | | ```

## Usage Example—Retrieve All Activity Records

This example describes how to retrieve all Activity Records from the Audit Database.

**Step 1 –** Send a GET request. For example:

| Format | Request |
| --- | --- |
| XML | `curl https://WKSWin2012:9699/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum -u Enterprise\NetwrixUser:NetwrixIsCool` |
| JSON | `curl https://WKSWin2012:9699/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum?format=json -u Enterprise\NetwrixUser:NetwrixIsCool` |

**Step 2 –** Receive the response. Activity Records are retrieved according to the account's delegated scope. Below is an example of a successful GET request. The status is 200 OK. For XML, a response body contains the `ActivityRecordList` root element with Activity Records and a Continuation mark inside. For JSON, a response body contains the `ActivityRecordList` array with Activity Records collected in braces \{\} and a Continuation mark.

```
{...} ```
```
], ```
```
"ContinuationMark": "PG5yPjxuIG49IntFNzA...PjwvYT48L24+PC9ucj4A" ```
```
} ```
|

**Step 3 –** Continue retrieving Activity Records. Send a POST request containing this Continuation mark to the same endpoint. See the [Continuation Mark](PostData/ContinuationMark.htm "Continuation Mark") topic for more information. For example:

|  |
| --- |
| XML |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: application/xml; Charset=UTF-8" https://WKSWin2012:9699/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum -u Enterprise\NetwrixUser:NetwrixIsCool --data-binary @C:\APIdocs\ContMark.xml`   ```
 ```
```
 ```
```
PG5yPjxuIG49IntFNzA...PjwvYT48L24+PC9ucj4A+PC9ucj4A ```
```
 ```
|
| JSON |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; Charset=UTF-8" https://WKSWin2012:9699/netwrix/api/v1/activity_records/enum?format=json -u Enterprise\NetwrixUser:NetwrixIsCool --data-binary` `@C:\APIdocs\ContMark.json`   ```
"PG5yPjxuIG49IntFNzA...PjwvYT48L24+PC9ucj4A+PC9ucj4A" ```
|

Ensure to pass information about transferred data, including `Content-Type:application/xml` or `application/json` and encoding. The syntax greatly depends on the tool you use.

**Step 4 –** Receive the next response. On success, the status is 200 OK. For XML, a response body contains the `ActivityRecordList` root element with next Activity Records and a new Continuation mark inside. For JSON, a response body contains the `ActivityRecordSearch` array with next Activity Records collected in braces \{\} and a new Continuation mark.

**Step 5 –** Continue retrieving Activity Records. Send POST requests containing new Continuation marks until you receive a 200 OK response with no Activity Records inside the `ActivityRecordList`. It means you reached the end of the Audit Database.
