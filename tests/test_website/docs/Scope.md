# VMware Monitoring Scope

You can fine-tune Netwrix Auditor by specifying various data types that you want to exclude/include from/in the VMware reports.

Follow the steps to exclude data from the VMware monitoring scope:

**Step 1 –** Navigate to the *%Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Vmware Auditing* folder.

**Step 2 –** Edit the \*.txt files, based on the following guidelines:

* Each entry must be a separate line.
* A wildcard (\*) is supported. You can use \* for cmdlets and their parameters.
* Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.

| File | Description | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| omitproplist.txt | Contains a list of object types and properties to be excluded from change reports. | `object_type.property_name`  If there is no separator (.) between an object type and aproperty, the whole entry is treated as an object type.  For example, to exclude the config.flags.monitorType property from reports, add the following line: `*.config.flags.monitorType`. |
| hidepropvalues.txt | Contains a list of object types and properties to be excluded from the reports when the property is set to certain value. | `object_type.property_name=property_value:object_type.hidden_property`  For example, to exclude the config.cpuAllocation.shares.level property when it equals to *"Low"*, add the following line: `*.config.cpuAllocation.shares .level=low:`  `*.config.cpuAllocation.shares.shares`. |
| proplist.txt | Contains a list of human-readable names for object types and properties to be displayed in the reports. | `inner_type:object_type.property=intelligiblename`  `Inner_type` is optional.  For example, if you want the configStatus property to be displayed in the reports as Configuration Status, add the following line:  `*.configStatus=Configuration Status.` |
| omitstorelist.txt | Contains a list of objects to be excluded from being saved to data storage and showing up in reports.  Audit data will still be collected. | Monitoring plan name, who, where, object type, what, property name, property value  For example, to exclude internal logons:  `*,*,*,Logon,*,UserAgent,VMware vim-java*`  The following characters must be preceded with a backslash () if they are a part of an entry value:  `*`  `,`  `\`  `?`  Characters may be also specified with hex value using *\xnnnn* template.  The spaces are trimmed. If they are required, use hex notation. For example: `Word\x0020 where \x0020` (with space at the end) means blank character. |
