# Configure Exchange for Monitoring Mailbox Access

Netwrix Auditor allows tracking non-owner mailbox access in your Exchange organization.

It is recommended to select **Adjust audit settings automatically** option when setting up Exchange monitoring in Netwrix Auditor. See the [Create a New Monitoring Plan](../../Admin/MonitoringPlans/Create.htm "Settings for Data Collection") topic for additional information.

However, in some scenarios users may need to apply required audit settings manually. For that, review the following procedures:

* [Configuring mailbox access tracking for Exchange 2019, 2016 and 2013 manually](#Configur "Configuring mailbox access tracking for Exchange 2019, 2016 and 2013 manually")
* [Configuring mailbox access tracking for Exchange 2010 manually](#Configur2 "Configuring mailbox access tracking for Exchange 2010 manually")

## Configuring mailbox access tracking for Exchange 2019, 2016 and 2013 manually

Perform the procedures below only if you do not want to enable the automatic audit configuration option when setting up monitoring in Netwrix Auditor.

You can configure auditing for:

* All mailboxes (User, Linked, Equipment, and Room mailbox)
* Selected mailboxes

| Track... | Steps... |
| --- | --- |
| All mailboxes | 1. On the computer where the monitored Exchange server is installed, navigate to **Start → Programs → Exchange Management Shell**. 2. Execute the following command:  Get-MailboxDatabase -Server \{0\} | foreach \{ Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox,SharedMailbox,EquipmentMailbox,LinkedMailbox,RoomMailbox | Set-Mailbox -AuditEnabled $true -AuditAdmin Update,Copy,Move,MoveToDeletedItems,SoftDelete,HardDelete,FolderBind,SendAs, SendOnBehalf,MessageBind,Create  -AuditDelegate Update,Move,MoveToDeletedItems,SoftDelete,HardDelete,FolderBind,SendAs,SendOnBehalf,Create \}  Where the *\{0\}* character must be replaced with your audited server FQDN name (e.g., *stationexchange.enterprise.local*).   If you are going to audit multiple Exchange servers, repeat these steps for each audited Exchange server. |
| Selected mailbox | 1. On the computer where the monitored Exchange server is installed, navigate to **Start → Programs → Exchange Management Shell**. 2.

Example: "Michael Jones"    * Domain\User. Example: enterprise.local\MJones    * GUID. Example: \{c43a7694-ba06-46d2-ac9b-205f25dfb32d\}    * (DN) Distinguished name. Example: CN=MJones,CN=Users,DC=enterprisedc1,DC=enterprise,DC=local    * User Principal Name. Example: MJones@enterprise.local   If you are going to audit multiple individual mailboxes, repeat these steps for each mailbox on each Exchange server. |
