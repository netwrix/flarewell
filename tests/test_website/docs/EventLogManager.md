# Event Log Manager

Netwrix Auditor Event Log Manager standalone tool consolidates and archives event log data, and allows setting up alerts on critical events including unauthorized access to mailbox in your Exchange organization and events generated by Auditor.

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html` "Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor") knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

* Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
* Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  + For Windows-based platforms: the **Remote Registry** service must be running and its **Startup Type** must be set to *"Automatic"*.
  + For Syslog-based platforms: the Syslog daemon must be configured to redirect events.

## Configure Audit Archiving Filters for Event Log

Audit archiving filters define what events will be saved to the Long-Term Archive or the Audit Database, and provide more granular reporting. For example, if you are going to audit Internet Information Services (IIS) or track health status of the product, enable the Internet Information Services Events or Netwrix Auditor System Health filter respectively. You can also skip certain events with exclusive filters (e.g., computer logons). You can enable or disable, and modify existing filters, and create new filters. To do it, click Configure next to Audit archiving filters.

The product allows creating inclusive and exclusive audit archiving filters.

Follow the steps to configure audit archiving filters.

**Step 1 –** To create or modify an audit archiving filter, see [Create Monitoring Plans for Event Logs](#Create "To create or edit an audit archiving filter").

**Step 2 –** To collect events required to generate a specific report, you must select a filter which name coincides with this report’s name. Click Enable and select Filters for Reports. All filters required to store events for all available reports will be selected automatically.

Follow the steps to create or edit an audit archiving filter.

**Step 1 –** On the Audit archiving filters page, click Add or select a filter and click Edit.

**Step 2 –** Complete the fields. Review the following for additional information:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| The Event tab | |
| Name | Specify the filter name. |
| Description | Enter the description for this filter (optional). |
| Event Log | Select an event log from the drop-down list. You will be alerted on events from this event log. You can also input a different event log.  To find out a log’s name, navigate to Start \> Windows Administrative Tools→ Event Viewer → Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows and expand the required  node, right-click the file under it and select Properties. Find the event log’s name in the Full Name field.  Netwrix Auditor Event Log Manager does not collect the Analytic and Debug logs, so you cannot configure alerts for these logs.  You can use a wildcard (\*). For inclusive filters: all Windows logs except for the ones mentioned above will be saved. For exclusive: all Windows logs events will be excluded. |
| Write to/Don't write to | Select the location to write/not to write events to, depending on the filter type (inclusive or exclusive).  It is recommended to write events both to the Long-Term Archive and to the Audit Database, because if your database is corrupted, you will be able to import the necessary data from the Long-Term Archive using the DB Importer tool. See [Import Audit Data with the Database Importer](#Import "Import Audit Data with the Database Importer")  for more information. |
| The Event Fields tab | |
| Event ID | Enter the identifier of a specific event that you want to be save. You can add several IDs separated by comma. |
| Event Level | Select the event types that you want to be save. If the Event Level check box is cleared, all event types will be saved.  If you want to select the inclusive Success Audit/Failure Audit filters, note that on these platforms these events belong to the “Information” level, so they will not be collected if you select the Information checkbox in the Exclusive Filters. |
| Computer | Specify a computer (as it is displayed in the Computer field in the event properties). Only events from this computer will be saved.  If you want to specify several computers, you can define a case-sensitive mask for this parameter. Below is an example of a mask:   * \* - any machine * computer – a machine named ‘computer’ * \*computer\* - machines with names like ‘xXxcomputerxXx’ or ‘newcomputer’ * computer? – machines with names like ‘computer1’ or ‘computerV’ * co?puter - machines with names like ‘computer’ or ‘coXputer’ * ????? – any machine with a 5-character name * ???\* - any machine with a 3-character name or longer |
| User | Enter a user’s name. Only events created by this user will be saved.  If you need to specify several users, you can define a mask for this parameter in the same way as described above. |
| Source | Specify this parameter if you want to save events from a specific source. Input the event source as it is displayed in the Source field in the event properties.  If you need to specify several sources, you can define a mask for this parameter in the same way as described above. |
| Category | Specify this parameter if you want to save a specific events category. |
| The Insertion Strings tab | |
| Consider the following event Insertion Strings | Specify this parameter if you want to store events containing a specific string in the EventData. You can use a wildcard (\*). Click Add and specify Insertion String. |
