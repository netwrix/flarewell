# Audit Configuration Assistant

Auditor Audit Configuration Assistant utility helps you to assess your environment readiness to being monitored with the product and automatically adjust the audit settings with the requirements.

It checks current settings of your Active Directory and Group Policies against those required for monitoring of selected data sources: Group Policy settings, auditing entries for directory partitions, and admin audit log settings of Exchange server. Assessment results are reported on the screen and can be downloaded as a PDF file.

You can instruct the utility to automatically apply the required settings.

For that, you should ensure that the account you plan to use for accessing the target domain has the necessary rights.

**Audit Configuration Assistant** is a part of Netwrix Auditor product setup. It is installed together with the Auditor client and can be launched from the **Start** **menu** **\>****Netwrix Auditor****\>****Netwrix Auditor Audit Configuration Assistant**. Alternatively, you can launch this utility from the monitoring plan wizard for Active Directory data source. See the [Launch Audit Configuration Assistant](#Launch "Launch Audit Configuration Assistant") section for additional information.

Currently, the utility supports Active Directory and Logon Activity data sources.

## Prerequisites

When working with the utility, you will need to provide an account with the rights required to access the AD audit entries and other settings. Thus, the account should be a member of the following groups:

* *Domain Admins* — to access audit policies and audit entries on the domain controllers
* *Enterprise Admins* — to configure audit entries for AD partitions
* *Organization Management* or *Records Management* (in Exchange organization) — to configure admin audit log settings

You can create a dedicated account for the assessment purposes, include it in these groups for the assessment period, and after finishing, remove it from these privileged groups.

## Usage

To assess and adjust the audit settings with Audit Configuration Assistant, take the following steps:

1. [Launch Audit Configuration Assistant](#Launch "Launch Audit Configuration Assistant")
2. [Start Assessment](#Start "Start Assessment")
3. [View Results](#View "View Results")
4. [Complete the process](#Complete "Complete the process")

## Launch Audit Configuration Assistant

Audit Configuration Assistant is a part of Netwrix Auditor product setup. It is installed together with Netwrix Auditor client and can be launched from the **Start** menu.

Select **Netwrix Auditor**→**Netwrix Auditor Audit Configuration Assistant**.

* If the utility is installed on the same machine as Netwrix Auditor server, you will be taken to the **Welcome** step.
* If the utility is installed on the remote machine together with Netwrix Auditor client, the initial window will allow you to enter the settings to connect to Netwrix Auditor Server. Specify the following:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Enter the name or IP address of Netwrix Auditor Server to connect to. |
| Use specified credentials | If not selected, then your current Windows credentials will be used to access Netwrix Auditor Server.  Select this option if you want to use other credentials |
| User | Enter user account in the *domain\name* format. |
| Password | Enter account password. |

After you click **Connect**, the connection with Netwrix Auditor Server will be established, and you will be taken to the **Welcome** step.

Alternatively, you can launch this utility by clicking the corresponding link:

* From [Create a New Monitoring Plan](../Admin/MonitoringPlans/Create.htm "Settings for Data Collection") for Active Directory data source.
* From the [Active Directory](../Admin/MonitoringPlans/ActiveDirectory/Overview.htm "Active Directory Plans") within the plan.

**Step 2 –** If you launched **Audit Configuration Assistant** from the **Start** menu (not from the monitoring plan settings), enter the name of Active Directory domain you want to assess.
