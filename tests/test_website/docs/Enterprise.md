# Enterprise Overview Dashboard

Enterprise Overview dashboard provide a high-level overview of activity trends by date, user, server, object type or audited system in your IT infrastructure. They allow you to see the activity trends by date, user, object type, server or audited IT system, and drill through to detailed reports for further analysis. The Enterprise diagram aggregates data on all Managed Objects and all audited systems, while system-specific diagrams provide quick access to important statistics within one audited system.

The current version of Netwrix Auditor contains the following diagrams:

* Enterprise (aggregates data on all audited systems listed below)
* Active Directory
* Exchange
* File Servers
* SharePoint
* SQL Server
* VMware
* Windows Server

If you are sure that some audit data is missing (e.g., you do not see information on your file servers in reports and search results), verify that the Audit Database settings are configured and that data is written to databases that reside on the default SQL Server instance.

By default, Auditor allows generating reports and running interactive searches on data collected in the last 180 days. If you want to investigate incidents that occurred more than 180 days ago, ask your Auditor Global administrator to import that data from the Long-Term Archive.

All diagrams provide the drill-down functionality, which means that by clicking on a segment, you will be redirected to a report with the corresponding filtering and grouping of data that renders the next level of detail.

Follow the steps to review a diagram:

* On the Auditor home screen, click the **Reports** tile and open the Enterprise Overview section. Click a tile to open a corresponding diagram.
* Navigate to Reports and select one of the following locations:

  | Title | Location |
  | --- | --- |
  | Enterprise | Organization Level Reports |
  | Active Directory Overview | Active Directory ® Active Directory Changes |
  | Exchange Overview | Exchange |
  | File Servers Overview | File Servers ® File Servers Activity |
  | SharePoint Overview | SharePoint |
  | SQL Server Overview | SQL Server |
  | VMware Overview | VMware |
  | Windows Server Overview | Windows Server ® Windows Server Changes |

The example below applies to Enterprise.

Each report has a set of filters which help organize audit data in the most convenient way. See the [View Reports](../View.htm "View Reports") topic for additional information. You can also create a subscription to any report you want to receive on a regular basis. See the [Subscriptions](../../Subscriptions/Overview.htm "Subscriptions") topic for additional information.
