# Sensitive Data Discovery

Sensitive Data Discovery is an integration module between Auditor and Netwrix Data Classification. It allows Auditor users to generate reports and configure alerts and search for the sensitive data collected and classified with Netwrix Data Classification (NDC). Refer to the following documentation to learn more about NDC:

* [[Netwrix Data Classification Documentation](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/dataclassification` "Netwrix Data Classification Documentation")](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/DataClassification_5.6.2/page/NDC_Overview`)

The integration can be configured for the following Auditor data sources:

SharePoint

* SharePoint
* SharePoint Online

File Storage Systems

* Windows File Servers
* EMC
* Netapp
* Nutanix Files
* Qumulo
* Synology

Databases

* SQL Server

The following integration options are available:

* NDC SQL Database Provider – This integration allows users to generate State-in-Time reports showing data categories for the sensitive data classified with Netwrix Data Classification. Available for File storage systems, SharePoint, and SharePoint Online.
* NDC Endpoint Provider – This integration allows users to receive alerts triggered by specific events related to the sensitive data classified with Netwrix Data Classification. When enabled, Netwrix users can also browse sensitive data with the search. Available for File storage systems (including Windows file server, EMC, NetApp, Nutanix File server, Synology, and Qumulo), SharePoint Online, and SQL Server.

This section lists all requirements for monitoring plans configuration and required versions of Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Data Classification. Also, it lists requirements for the accounts used by Sensitive Data Discovery .

## Permissions for Integration with Netwrix Data Classification

The account must be granted the following rights and permissions:

* The Database datareader server role must be assigned to the account on the SQL Server instance where the NDC SQL database resides.

Netwrix recommends using different accounts to connect to the SQL Server instances where NDC SQL database and Categories database reside.

**NOTE:** Netwrix Data Classification and Netwrix Auditor integration (NDC Provider) currently does not support Single Sign-On. Single Sign-on needs to be disabled in Netwrix Data Classification in order for the account used by the NDC Provider to authenticate.

The account you are using for integration should have Rest API access in the Netwrix Data Classification. You can add it in **NDC console \> Settings \> Users**. Refer to the [Netwrix Data Classification documentation](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/dataclassification` "Netwrix Data Classification documentation") for additional information.

## Requirements for Monitoring Plans in Netwrix Auditor

For File Storage Systems:

* Monitoring plan for File Servers data source with activity audit enabled in Netwrix Auditor;
* Netwrix Data Classification instance configured to crawl from the same source (naming must exactly match)

For SharePoint:

* Monitoring plan for SharePoint data source with activity audit enabled in Netwrix Auditor
* Netwrix Data Classification  instance configured to crawl from the same source;

For SharePoint Online:

* Monitoring plan for SharePoint Online data source with activity audit enabled in Netwrix Auditor
* Netwrix Data Classification instance configured to crawl from the same source

For SQL Server:

* Monitoring plan for SQL Server data source with activity audit enabled in Netwrix Auditor
* Netwrix Data Classification instance configured to crawl from the same source;

## Software Requirements

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Netwrix Auditor | 10.0+ |
| Netwrix Data Classification | 5.6.1+ |

## Enable and configure Sensitive Data Discovery

This section contains instructions on how to enable and configure Sensitive Data Discovery to include sensitive data in Netwrix Auditor reports, search, and alerts.

Ensure that your account meets the requirements and has all server roles assigned. Follow these steps to enable and configure Sensitive Data Discovery:

**Step 1 –** In Netwrix Auditor, navigate to Setting in the upper right corner.

**Step 2 –** Select **Sensitive Data Discovery**.

**Step 3 –** Configure the following settings:

* Enable NDC SQL Database Provider – Select Enable in the Connect to NDC SQL database field and then click Configure to specify NDC SQL database connection settings.
* SQL Server instance – Specify the name of the SQL Server instance where the NDC SQL database resides
* Database – Specify the name of the database (NDC SQL database by default)
* Authentication – Select the authentication type you want to use to connect to the SQL Server instance:

  + Windows authentication
  + SQL Server authentication
* User name – Specify the account to be used to connect to the SQL Server instance. For example, *WORKSTATIONNDC/integrator*.
* Password – Provide a password for that account
* Enable NDC Endpoint Provider – Select Enable in the Connect to NDC via API field and then click Configure to specify NDC endpoint connection settings.

  + NDC Web Console address – Provide the URL of your Netwrix Data Classification web console. For example: *`http://workstationndc/conceptQS*.`
  + User name – Provide the name of account that will be used to connect to NDC web console. For example, *WORKSTATIONNDC/integrator*. A user must be granted both: the 'REST API User' and 'Superuser' permissions in NDC. See the User Management topic in the [Netwrix Data Classification Documentation](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/dataclassification` "Netwrix Data Classification Documentation") for additional information.
  + Password – Provide a password for that account

## What is Next

Follow the steps to run a data collection and review sensitive data.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to your File storage system, SharePoint, SharePoint Online, or SQL Server monitoring plan.

**Step 2 –** Run data collection.

**Step 3 –** Consider that data collection for SharePoint Online may take a while.

**Step 4 –** Perform some changes and run data collection again.

**Step 5 –** Review sensitive data.

Netwrix suggests the following integration scenarios:

For NDC SQL Database Provider:

Review your sensitive data in Data Discovery and Classification reports. Refer to the following Netwrix Auditor help center article for more information about these reports: [Data Discovery and Classification Reports](../Reports/Types/DataDiscoveryClassification.htm "Data Discovery and Classification Reports").

ForNDC Endpoint Provider:

* Browse your data with Netwrix search.
* **NOTE:** Shortly after the data collection, changes related to sensitive content are reported without data categories. For example, if a user adds some sensitive data to the SharePoint Online document that initially does not contain sensitive data; this will be reported as document modification with empty "*data categories*" field. Another example: a user creates a new document containing sensitive data on a file server; this will be reported as a file add with empty "data categories" field. In this case, you have to wait until Netwrix Auditor processes information collected by NDC. It takes a while depending on a number of processed objects in your infrastructure and reindexing settings configured in Netwrix Data Classification. See the Manage Sources and Control Data Processing topic in the [Netwrix Data Classification Documentation](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/dataclassification` "Netwrix Data Classification Documentation") for additional information.
* Click the **Select** column in the Tools menu and review data categories (taxonomies) of your sensitive documents.
* Use filtering capabilities to narrow your search results. See the [Use Filters in Advanced Mode](../Search/FilterAdvanced.htm "Use Filters in Advanced Mode") topic for additional information.
* Create an alert triggered by specific actions with your sensitive data.

***RECOMMENDED:*** Netwrix recommends enable threshold to trigger the new alert. In this case, a single alert will be sent instead of many alerts. This can be helpful when Netwrix Auditor detects many activity records matching the filters you specified. See the [Alerts](../AlertSettings/Overview.htm "Alerts") topic for additional information.
