# Navigation

There are two ways to access Platform Governance for NetSuite's functionality: the **Strongpoint** tab on the NetSuite tab bar or from the **Strongpoint Overview**. Menu options are available based on your [License Type](installing_strongpoint/features_by_license_type.htm "Features by License Type"). In addition, menu items can be hidden for each account through [Menu Management](installing_strongpoint/managing_menus.htm "Managing your Menus"). These examples show all the options for an **Enterprise Compliance** license.

If you do not see the **Strongpoint** tab, contact your Administrator regarding [Setting Tab Access](installing_strongpoint/setting_strongpoint_tab_access.htm "Set Access to the Strongpoint tab.").
