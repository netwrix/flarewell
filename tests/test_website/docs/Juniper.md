# Configure Juniper Devices

Netwrix Auditor relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment and on the Auditor console computer. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or incomplete audit data.

**CAUTION:** Folder associated with Netwrix Auditor must be excluded from antivirus scanning. See the [Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor](`https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000HirCAE.html` "Antivirus Exclusions for Netwrix Auditor") knowledge base article for additional information.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

* Automatically through a monitoring plan – This is a recommended method. If you select to automatically configure audit in the target environment, your current audit settings will be checked on each data collection and adjusted if necessary.
* Manually – Native audit settings must be adjusted manually to ensure collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Auditor to continually enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually:

  + The target Juniper device must be configured via JunOS Command Line Interface (CLI) as described below.

To configure you Juniper devices, do the following:

1. Launch the JunOS Command Line Interface (CLI).
2. Execute the following commands:

   # configure

   # set system syslog host  any info

   where `` is the IP address of the computer where Netwrix Auditor Server is installed.

   # set system syslog host  port \

   where

   `` is the IP address of the computer where Netwrix Auditor Server is installed

   AND

   `` is the name of the UDP port used to listen to network devices (514 port used by default). [Network Devices](../../Admin/MonitoringPlans/NetworkDevices.htm "Network Devices Plans")

   # set system syslog time-format \

   # commit
