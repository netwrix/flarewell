# Self-Audit

Built-in Netwrix Auditor self-audit allows you to track changes to the product configuration, including monitoring plans, data sources, audit scope and details about it (before-after values). This helps you to ensure that monitoring scope is complete and changed only in line with the workflows adopted by our organization.

The corresponding option is available on the General tab of Netwrix AuditorSettings. By default, the **Collect data for self-audit checkbox** is selected (enabled).
