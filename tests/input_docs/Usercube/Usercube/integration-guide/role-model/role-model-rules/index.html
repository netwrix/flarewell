              Entitlement Management
              </a> and how it influences assigning entitlements to identities. Let's sum up the key principles here.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li value="1">Identities are resources.</li>
                                        <li value="2">Assignments of entitlements are materialized by resources, their values and associations.</li>

                                        <li value="8">The role model contains provisioning rules describing if and how target resources and their values should be computed from source resource values.</li>

                                    <p>One of <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>'s distinctive feature is the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control">Attribute-Based Access Control</a> methods to automatically grant fine-grained entitlements.</p>
                                    <p>Every identity in the organization operates within a specific context. It is a set of information relevant to making decisions about assigning entitlements for an identity. For example, an employee working in the R&amp;D department of the New York office at Contoso Corporation is associated with the { <code>R&amp;D</code>, <code>New York</code> } context.</p>
                                    <p>Analyzing contexts in the organization allows the integration team, in collaboration with a knowledgeable member of the target organization, to define key criteria on which to base assignments of entitlements decisions. Those key criteria are called dimensions.</p>
                                    <p>The integration team defines <a href="../../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/contextrule/index.html" target="_parent" title="ContextRule" alt="ContextRule" class="MCXref xref">
              
              Context Rule

              Record Section
              </a>in the applicative configuration that assigns, for every identity, a context as a set of dimension-value pair.</p>
                                    <p>The details of how contexts are generated can be found in <a href="../../role-assignment/generate-contexts/index.html" target="_parent" title="Generate Contexts" alt="Generate Contexts" class="MCXref xref">

                                    <p>Every dimension is associated with a finite set of possible values. That means there is a finite set of possible context. Hence, typical contexts within which an identity operates are modeled.</p>
                                    <p>Contexts can then be used as a filter for choosing an identity to which to assign a role.</p>
                                    <p>This mechanism allows the integration team to define rules to take care of the most basics and repetitive assignments. For example, a <a href="../../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerolerule/index.html" target="_parent" title="SingleRoleRule" alt="SingleRoleRule" class="MCXref xref">Single Role Rule</a> assigning a specific single role to the resources that match a specific context.</p>
                                    <h5 id="example">Example</h5>
                                    <p>A standard multi-site and multi-department organization would use the following dimensions:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>Location</code>, the physical location where an employee works.</li>
                                        <li><code>Department</code>, the employee working department, such as <code>IT</code>, <code>Sales</code> or <code>Accounting</code>.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Roles could be assigned based on location and department of the resource representing an identity.</p>
                                    <p>For a rule such as "every employee that works in IT must have access to the servers room", the <code>ServerRoomAccess</code> single role would be assigned to every resource of entity type <code>employee</code> whose context contains the value <code>IT</code> for the dimension <code>Department</code>.</p>
                                    <p>A context rule would have been written first, defining for every resource of entity type <code>employee</code> how to compute a context: the <code>Department</code> dimension value is found in the <code>department</code> property of the resource, the <code>Location</code> dimension value is found in the <code>site</code> property of the resource.</p>
                                    <h2 id="write-roles-and-assignments-rules">Write Roles And Assignments Rules</h2>
                                    <p>The role model takes a very important place in the applicative configuration. It's built by the integration team, in collaboration with the target organization, to match the organization's needs and rules in security.</p>
                                    <p>The role model is built iteratively, together with the <a href="../../entity-model/index.html" target="_parent" class="MCXref xref">Entity Model</a>, as they closely influence one another.</p>
                                    <p>The role model evolves and lives during the whole IGA project's lifecycle. Organization rules change, roles and assignment rules are updated, deleted, added.</p>
                                    <p>The following gives a few ideas about how a to approach the writing of a role model.</p>
                                    <h3 id="1-identify-single-roles">1. Identify single roles</h3>
                                    <p>The first iteration of building of the organization reference model starts to reveal the archetypal responsibilities and positions of the members of the organization. A <a href="../../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/singlerole/index.html" target="_parent" title="SingleRole" alt="SingleRole" class="MCXref xref">
              
              Single Role
              </a> is defined for every fine-grained organization-level responsibility or position.</p>
                                    <h5 id="example-1">Example</h5>
                                    <p>Contoso Corporation employs project managers in their Aircraft Design department to manage aircraft design projects for clients all around the world. Those projects involve aerodynamics and structure engineers, construction workers, quality control agents and sale engineers.</p>
                                    <p>Everyone in the team needs to access the Internet to do research and send e-mails. That's a first typical single role <code>Internet Access</code> that everyone should be assigned to be able to work.</p>
                                    <p>Aerodynamics engineers need to access remote high-performance computation servers specifically designed to solve aerodynamics equations. The sensitive nature of the data sent to those servers, plus the availability constraints, require restricting access to engineers that absolutely need it to perform their daily tasks. That's another responsibility, that can be translated to a single role <code>Aerodynamics Computation Server</code> for example, that grants access to those servers.</p>
                                    <p>Structure engineers, on the other hand, do not perform such heavy computations and do not need access to the aerodynamics computation server. They can work locally, performing computations on their own workstation. They're not assigned the <code>Aerodynamics Computation Server</code> role.</p>
                                    <p>Quality control agents need access to sensitive information such as accident reports, on the internal data server named <code>data0</code>. Those highly sensitive privileges are not assigned to everyone. They can be translated to the <code>Data Server data0</code> role.</p>
                                    <p>The project manager needs access to the <code>data0</code> and <code>data1</code> servers with client contracts. The <code>Data Server data0</code> and <code>Data Server data1</code> roles translate those responsibilities.</p>

                                    <p>Hence, for every single role, the relevant managed systems, type of resource, and resource values to fulfill are identified.</p>
                                    <p>They are materialized by:</p>

                                            <p>Sets of scalar rules and navigation rules relevant to a specific resource type are gathered into a <MadCap:xref href="../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcetype/index.html" target="_parent">resource type</MadCap:xref>.</p>

                                    <p>Let's consider the <code>Internet Access</code> defined at step 1.</p>
                                    <p>In practice, Contoso Corporation authorizes or block a user Internet access by setting per-user outbound policies on their network firewall. The firewall integrates with Active Directory which make it possible to use Active Directory groups membership to enable or disable policies for a user.</p>
                                    <p>A security officer, to grant Internet access to an employee, would in practice assign a <code>Internet Access</code> group membership to their Active Directory account. That is a fine-grained entitlement entailed by the assignment of the <code>Internet Access</code> single role. That means that, to be able to grant or restrict Internet access, the link between an identity and their Active Directory account, used to login to work, must be known.</p>
                                    <p>To modelize that need within the role model, every identity with <code>Internet Access</code> single role is associated with an Active Directory account. We can find the Active Directory for an identity by comparing the identity email with the Active Directory entry e-mail. That's an example of <a href="../../toolkit/xml-configuration/provisioning/resourcecorrelationrule/index.html" target="_parent" title="ResourceCorrelationRule" alt="ResourceCorrelationRule" class="MCXref xref">
