                                    <p>The algorithm is applied by the server to a resource. It has the following responsibilities:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Enforcing the assignment rules: the algorithm outputs a list of expected assignments for the input resource</li>

                                    <p>The main responsibility of the Evaluate Policy is to compute, for every fed resource, the set of assignments of entitlements that comply with the assignment policy.</p>
                                    <p>That set is composed of roles that should be assigned to the resource and of scalar and navigation assignments that should exist for that resource as an owner. The latter are in fact values of target resource properties to fulfill from that resource fed in the algorithm. Those assignments are referred to as the expected assignments. Manual assignments and derogations are included as well, as they become rules within the assignment policy.</p>
                                    <p>Evaluate Policy also identifies the existing assignments. They represent the actual assignments read (or more accurately, deduced) from the managed systems' resources.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, the differences between the existing assignments and the expected assignments are computed. As a result, a set of non-conforming assignments is revealed, to be fixed by provisioning or validated as derogations.</p>
                                    <p>Later, provisioning orders are edited, validated by a knowledgeable user and sent to the agent for connectors to fulfill and fix the differences.</p>
                                    <p>Evaluate Policy is executed by the task <code>Usercube-Compute-RoleModel</code>, usually included in a regularly scheduled provisioning job.</p>

                                    <p>Resource type rules are enforced. This means creating and adding assigned resource types to the expected assignments list. This means enforcing the need for a resource of that type to be created in the managed systems, with the input resource as its owner.</p>
                                    <p>Then automation rules are enforced on assigned resource types.</p>
                                    <p>A further step will correlate, to find the actual target resource if it exists. If not, it will eventually become a provisioning order to create such a resource.</p>
                                    <p>This can be seen as assigning a target resource to an owner. It's still important to note that the act of assigning a resource to an owner almost always is the consequence of a role assignment. Use cases for which a single, isolated resource, is "assigned" (i.e. created with specific values) is rare and is more of a solution to a specific technical problem.</p>
                                    <p class="Bold_Subheading">Enforcing navigation rules</p>
                                    <p>Finally, navigation rules are enforced. They aim to complete the information about the resource to be created because of the assigned resource types. If the type rule is the what, this is the how.</p>
                                    <p>For every assigned resource type, associated navigation rules are enforced.</p>
                                    <p>Navigation rules are conditioned on the resource's assigned single roles. If a specific single role is found as assigned to the owner resource of the assigned resource type (i.e. the input resource of the algorithm), an assigned resource navigation is created in the UP_AssignedResourceNavigation table, with the resource as its owner. The assigned resource navigation will eventually translate into a provisioning order.</p>
                                    <p>The assigned resource navigation is hence the consequence, in the form of a provisioning-order-to-be, of assigning a role to a resource.</p>
                                    <p>This means also no assigned resource type, no navigation assignment. Resource type rules are a prerequisite for the associated navigation rules to be enforced.</p>
                                    <p class="Bold_Subheading">Enforcing scalar rules</p>
                                    <p>Finally, the scalar rules associated with the target's resource type are enforced and become assigned resource scalars that will also result in a provisioning order.</p>
                                    <p>For every  assigned resource type, associated scalar rules are enforced.</p>
                                    <p>They also aim to complete the information about the resource to be created because of the assigned resource types.</p>
                                    <p>Found manual assignments and derogation of resource types with their associated navigation and scalar assignments are added as well.</p>

                                    <p>Resource correlation rules are enforced: for every expected assigned resource type, the algorithm looks for a target resource that correlates the owner, which is the input resource.</p>
                                    <p>If found, that correlated resource becomes the target of the assigned resource type. If not, a provisioning order of creation is written.</p>

                                        <p>A word about correlation. Correlation is achieved by using resource correlation rules. Each rule applies to a resource type. It defines for the source entity type a quantity computed from its attributes. It does the same for the target entity types. Those quantities are called correlation keys. For a given assigned resource type, the correlation algorithm tries to match the owner correlation key with all available resources of entity type target. If one is found equal, the matching resource becomes target of said assigned resource type. For every resource, correlation keys are computed by a regularly scheduled task and stored in the database.</p>

                                    <p>Expected assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations matching existing counterparts are found.</p>
                                    <p>For every assigned resource type, assigned resource scalar and assigned resource navigation, the provisioning state is updated according to the correlated target resource values, the matching existing assignment state and the provisioning state transition algorithm.</p>
                                    <p>For expected assignments that have a matching existing counterpart, the correlated target resource values are analyzed. If they match the expected resource values, that means that the last provisioning order has been indeed well executed. The provisioning state of the associated assignment is switched to Applied. Same goes for the role assignments from which those scalar and navigation assignments originated.</p>
                                    <p>For expected assignments that do not have a matching existing counterpart, they receive their Pending or Blocked provisioning state.</p>
                                    <p>Blocked assignments are submitted for validation in the provisioning review screen. Blocked assigned resource types are associated with a confidence level that describes the level of confidence of the correlation between source and target. The confidence level is a configuration of the resource correlation rules.</p>
                                    <p>The workflow state is also analyzed; assignments with Approved (or Cancellation) have been approved (or denied) and can now be provisioned.</p>

                                    <p>The existing and expected assignment lists are compared and yield a third list of differences, i.e. non conforming values in the managed systems that need to be fixed.</p>
                                    <p>That list will eventually become provisioning orders that will be sent to the agent for fulfillment.</p>

                                    <p>If the existing assignment is not yet <code>Applied</code> the agent might still be preparing the provisioning.

<a name="assigned-star"></a></p>
                                    <p>Expected assignments are:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Assigned composite roles and assigned single roles, representing roles assigned to the resource</li>
                                        <li>Assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations, representing scalar and navigation properties to fulfill to a target resource from that source resource, the ownership relationship between source and target being materialized by an assigned resource type.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Expected assigned&#160;are written to the database, they will be the basis for the next step: fixing differences. The writing is optimized by using bulk insert methods.</p>
                                    <p>To enhance the writing performances, it's not actual assigned* that are written, but updates from the existing ones, using the delta computed at step 7.</p>
                                    <p>For fine-grained assignments such as assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations, <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>&#160;stores the policy value i.e. the value computed by Evaluate Policy (not yet fulfilled) and the current value i.e. the value currently held by the target resource in the managed systems.</p>
                                    <p>From there, it is possible to retrieve the differences between existing and expected assignments for that resource, at any time.</p>
                                    <p>Remember, the goal of building a set of assignments is twofold:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Building a catalog of existing assignments as assigned roles for non-technical users to consult.</li>
                                        <li>Fulfill target values from source resources so as the managed systems comply with the role model.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The catalog of existing assignments is now available: they are assigned* with an Applied provisioning state. Non technical-users can read assigned single roles and assigned composite roles. Technical users will be more interested in assigned resource scalars and assigned resource navigations.</p>
                                    <p>Fulfilling target values from source resources is going to take the form of provisioning orders, computed from assigned resource scalars and navigations in the Pending or Blocked state.</p>
                                    <h2>Fixing Differences</h2>
                                    <p>The engine has computed a list of expected assignments. The difference with the managed system state, as a list of resource values that infer differences in role assignments, can be fixed by provisioning the expected assignments to the managed systems.</p>
                                    <p>Some provisioning orders have to be reviewed by a knowledgeable user. Those are provisioning orders computed from assigned* with a Blocked provisioning state. The UI provides screens to perform review and validation.</p>
                                    <p>Every provisioning order is to fix a difference that has been caused by a change in the source resource values or in its target resources.</p>
                                    <p>Let's see in details what kind of differences <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> deals with, and what kind of change in the managed systems triggers them.</p>
                                    <p>The workflow state of an assignment helps identify the nature of a difference between that assignment and the managed systems.</p>
                                    <h3>UI overview</h3>
                                    <p>Differences are displayed in the following screens:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Provisioning Review</strong> displays <code>Blocked</code> (non <code>Found</code>, non <code>Historic</code>) assigned resource types, assigned resource navigations and assigned resource scalars. They must be reviewed by a knowledgeable technical end-user. They are assignments mirroring legit provisioning orders recently computed by the Evaluate Policy.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Resource Reconciliation</strong> displays <code>Found</code> and <code>Historic</code> assigned resource types, assigned resource navigations and assigned resource scalars. This is where non-conforming resource values or non-authorized accounts (i.e. a resource that should not exist at all) in the form of provisioning assignments are displayed. These assignments mirror, at the resource value level, derogations still not explicitly refused by a knowledgeable end-user. This is where an end-user can find provisioning assignments that would render legit the non-confirming values and non-authorized accounts found in the managed systems.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Role Reconciliation</strong> displays <code>Found</code> and <code>Historic</code> assigned single roles and assigned composite roles. They are role assignments that mirror derogations, at the role level, still not explicitly refused by a knowledgeable end-user. This is where an end-user can find roles assignments that would render legit the non-confirming values and non-authorized accounts found in the managed systems.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Redundant Assignments</strong> displays <code>Approved</code> assigned roles and assigned resource types tagged as eligible to be turned into <code>Calculated</code>.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p class="Remember" data-mc-autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;color: #fb8000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remember, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"><span class="autonumber"><span class="Remember"><span style="color: #fb8000;" class="mcFormatColor"><i>Remember, </i></span></span></span><strong>Role Review</strong> is a little bit different as it displays manually requested assignments waiting for manual approval.</p>
                                    <h3>A target value to update</h3>
                                    <p>A target resource scalar value is different from the scalar value obtained by applying scalar rules to the source resource.</p>
                                    <p>This could be caused by a change in the target value directly from within the managed system, before or after <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>&#160;has been plugged in. For example, a target Active Directory account Email value has been changed.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state Historic or Found given the difference is about a change in the target made outside/before <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>&#160;and found by synchronization.</p>
                                    <p>As <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>&#160;does not overwrite managed systems values without confirmation from a knowledgeable user, the found non-conforming value will be displayed in the <strong>Resource Reconciliation</strong> screen, with the suggestion for update. The non-conforming value can either be kept, and become an exception and overwritten with the rules-issued value.</p>
                                    <p>This could also be caused by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the Name of an employee. Synchronization has detected the change in value, and reapplied rules. And now, the target Active Directory account name has to be updated.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state PolicyApproved given the difference is about a change in the source that caused the need for a change in the target because of the applications of the rules.</p>
                                    <p>This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the <strong>Provisioning Review</strong> screen for validation in the form of a resource update provisioning order.</p>
                                    <h3>A target resource to create</h3>
                                    <p>A target resource is missing. Applying navigation rules to a source resource yielded the need for a specific target resource that has not been found by synchronization.</p>
                                    <p>This could be caused by a missing resource in a managed system even before <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> was plugged-in or the deletion of such a resource in the managed system afterward. For example, a nominative Active Directory account has not been created yet for that existing identity.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state Historic or Found given the difference is about a change or an omission in the target outside/before <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> and found by synchronization.</p>
                                    <p>This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the <strong>Provisioning Review</strong> screen for validation in the form of a missing resource provisioning order.</p>
                                    <p>This could also be caused by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the Job Title of an employee. Synchronization has detected it, and reapplied rules, and now, this identity has to be awarded a new Active Directory account with higher privileges.</p>
                                    <p>Or it could be caused by the manual assignment of a new Role from within <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> to an existing identity that would grant that identity with a new account and hence a target resource to create.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state <code>PolicyApproved</code> given the difference is about a change in the source that caused the need to create a new target because of the applications of the rules.</p>
                                    <p>Those cases yield a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the <strong>Provisioning Review</strong> screen for validation in the form of a resource creation provisioning order.</p>
                                    <h3>A target resource to delete</h3>
                                    <p>An extra target resource has been found by synchronization, it's been correlated with our source resource, but no navigation rules applied to the source resource yielded the need for its existence.</p>
                                    <p>This could be caused by an extra resource created directly from within a managed system, or the change of a rule that makes some existing resources moot. For example, an administration Active Directory account has been created directly from the managed system and granted to an identity who, according to the rules, is not entitled to it.</p>
                                    <p>As <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> does not overwrite managed systems values without confirmation from a knowledgeable user, the found non-authorized account will be displayed in the <strong>Resource Reconciliation</strong> screen, with the suggestion for deletion. The non-authorized account can either be kept, and become an exception and or be deleted to comply with the rules.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state <code>Historic</code> or <code>Found</code> given the difference is about an extra target added outside/before <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> and found by synchronization.</p>
                                    <p>This could also be cause by a change in the source resource, by a previous fulfillment of <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>, or directly from within the managed system. For example, the HR system has updated the <code>Job Title</code> of an employee. Synchronization has detected it, and reapplied rules, and now, this identity has to be awarded a new Active Directory account with lower privileges, the old one must be deleted.</p>
                                    <p>Or it could be caused by explicitly denying a Role to an existing identity from within <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> which would ripple through and forbid this account from existing.</p>
                                    <p>The corresponding assigned* would be awarded a workflow state <code>PolicyApproved</code> given the difference is about a change in the source that caused the need to deletion a target because of the applications of the rules.</p>
                                    <p>This case yields a provisioning order, that could be blocked, and hence displayed in the <strong>Provisioning Review</strong> screen for validation in the form of a resource deletion provisioning order.</p>

                                        <p>Provisioning orders are still fairly technical to read. Non compliant-roles, inferred from non-compliant resources in the managed systems, are also displayed in the <strong>Role Reconciliation</strong> screen to be kept or deleted by less technical users.</p>
