                                            </blockquote>
                                            <p>They are a trade-off between having enough assignments to work efficiently but not too many as to pose a security threat.</p>

                                            <p>In a target application, it is granting an account membership for a group, changing a person's clearance level, adding an authorized account to the access control list of a resource, etc.</p>
                                            <p>Performing an assignment requires a great deal of knowledge about the inner mechanisms of the target authorization mechanism.

In the end, talking about entitlements is talking about roles. No more multiple obscure authorization mechanisms.</p>
                                            <p>This makes thinking about entitlements within <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>&#160;easy. The provisioning issues stay out of the way, and all the energy can be focused on designing the perfect assignment policy.</p>
                                            <p>The appropriate model also helps formalizing rules that can be used for automation.</p>

                                            <p>Assignment decisions for a user are always made based on the user's needs and legitimacy.</p>

                                                <p><strong>FAQ</strong>: Are employees working on tasks that need this assignment? Are they senior enough to have that responsibility?</p>

                                            <p>The basis for an assignment decision can be seen as a set of "identity attributes" that represent the place of the employee in the organization.</p>
                                            <p>We can formalize these "identity attributes", on which informal assignment decisions are made, by translating them into dimensions. <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>'s dimensions are exactly that: key criteria, on which assignment decisions are based.</p>
                                            <p>Just as roles, dimensions are a fundamental piece of the puzzle. Choosing dimensions forces users to sit down and really think about what really motivates assignment decisions in the organization. It is going to help with automation but it is also going to help come up with better decision rules, and hence improve the overall security of the organization. Assignment rules naturally flow from dimensions and roles.</p>

                                            <p>Roles and dimensions are the basis for a language that enables users to formalize, in a very explicit way, the assignment policy: who should get what entitlement. Dimensions are criteria for decisions and roles are the result of a decision. We are now only missing the rules that map criteria to roles.</p>
                                            <p>Those are the assignment rules: single role rules and composite role rules.</p>
                                            <p>Writing the assignment policy actually becomes very easy. Once dimensions and roles are identified, assignment rules become obvious.</p>
                                            <p>The last difficulty is provisioning those assignments.</p>

                                            <p>Translating roles into provisioning orders is finding out how the target application should be changed to satisfy the assignments.

                                            <p>Provisioning mechanisms all follow this pattern:</p>

                                                </li>
                                                <li value="3">
                                                    <p>Compute the value of the data that should be updated in the target resource. That's <strong>provisioning rules</strong>.</p>

                                            <p>One last point to consider is that provisioning rules and correlation sometimes depend on the type of resource we are handling. Authorization mechanisms often discriminate between resources, depending on their relevance for security. We might need specific provisioning rules to enforce this difference.</p>
                                            <p>The resource type materializes the classification of resources of the same application into categories relevant from a security point of view. As a bonus, classifying resources help with governance.</p>
