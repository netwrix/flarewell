                                        <p>Contact your Account Manager to request a SOC1 type 2 report. Reports are available by the end of January. A bridge letter can be provided if necessary.</p>
                                        <p><span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> does not presently issue SOC2 reports.</p>

                                        <p>Many of our customers install <span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> in their sandbox before installing it in production. Your license covers both sandbox and production instances. We currently do not have the ability to have the bundle installed in release previews.</p>
                                        <h4 id="is_our_private_data_being_transmitted_or_shared_in_any_way"><a name="Is" id="Is"/>Is our private data being transmitted or shared in any way?</h4>
                                        <p><span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> is completely contained within NetSuite and Salesforce. It utilizes the platform’s custom records and APIs to create and manage documentation. No data leaves the system at anytime to ensure compliance with data security requirements for critical system and process data. All code and key tools are locked to ensure consistent processes within the application. Access to records can be restricted by role or user using standard NetSuite and Salesforce access controls. In addition, <span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> supports a secondary level of audience management for specific processes or objects.</p>
                                        <p>All documentation can be printed, rendered as flat HTML or exported to an external repository and can be reimported and retained for archiving purposes by an authorized user.</p>
                                        <h4 id="what_is_the_time_or_effort_required_to_use_platform_governance_for_netsuite"><a name="What" id="What"/>What is the time or effort required to use Platform Governance for NetSuite?</h4>
                                        <p>A lot less than you would expect. The first phase is to get your complete customization documentation library. All this requires is for the Administrator to install the bundle, press “Start Spider” and let the system run. After a few nights, the system documentation is complete and you can review the results in the Status Report.</p>
                                        <p>We have User Guides and online videos to walk you through Clean Up, Script Analysis and other capabilities. Because <span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> creates complete documentation and updates on an ongoing basis with your NetSuite and Salesforce records, you can use the pre-built searches or create your own to get instant visibility into your account. While <span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> greatly reduces the amount of time to find information and identify interdependencies, the NetSuite and Salesforce Administrators will still need to do the appropriate due diligence and analysis to ensure their actions are appropriate and safe.</p>

                                        <p>Licenses are only required for editors of <span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> (i.e. people who create or edit processes or view customization documentation). No license is required for users who merely view documentation. A company will normally start with a small team (the base includes three seats) and then add users as their usage expands.</p>
