                                        <p>There are many clean up and documentation tools available such as:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Unused Customizations</li>
                                            <li>Unused Scripts</li>
                                            <li>Inactive Owner</li>
                                            <li>Default ID</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Unused fields and unused fields by form do not include fields that do not store a value since there is no Date Last Used for those objects.</p>
                                        <p>All the “Unused” tools with the exception of Unused Bundles do not include customizations from bundles. For example, even if a field is not used,  it is highly unlikely that you will delete a field from a bundle. You would likely want to analyze the bundle usage as a whole when cleaning up.</p>
                                        <p>Consider deleting unused customizations, such as fields that have not been used in years and are not used by any other customization, before moving onto other clean up activities.</p>

                                        <p>Most of the tools have the following columns. They might be in slightly different orders or omitted based on the type of clean up.</p>

                                        <p>You can report on these statuses to organize your work.</p>

                                        <p>Some changes such as deletion, changes to scriptID and Help impact the customization itself. For these types of changes we recommend creating a Change Request. </p>
                                        <p>However, for Clean Up, you can create new change requests and assign them to the customizations. In the results view, “Create Change Request”  creates a new change request. Once that is added to that customization it will appear under “Related Change Requests”. You can have multiple customizations assigned to multiple change requests as appropriate.</p>

                                        <p>You can find more information about how to use the Change Request under Change Management. Once the appropriate investigations are conducted and approvals are obtained the customization can be changed as appropriate based on company policies and procedures.</p>
                                        <p>Some of the items being changed, such as the description or owner, can be direct list edited or bulk edited like any other NetSuite data directly in a  view such as Unused Fields.</p>
                                        <p>The Change Request has archiving and deletion tools to help clean up the account, for example, <a href="cleanup_unused_customizations.htm" title="Open Clean Up Unused Customizations topic" alt="Open Clean Up Unused Customizations topic">deleting unused customizations</a>.</p>

                                        <p>At the end of the process of updating the customization record, the account should be re-spidered to update the Customization Records that document the customizations that were changed. It can be re-spidered just for a particular record type that is all that was changed.</p>
