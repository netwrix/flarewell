                                        <p>The Automated Search Clean Up feature runs as scheduled, or on demand, using custom rules to find and manage Saved Searches. Accumulated searches contribute to inefficiency in NetSuite accounts.</p>
                                        <p class="note">Review the <a href="automated_search_cleanup_considerations.htm" title="Open Automated Search Clean Up Considerations topic" alt="Open Automated Search Clean Up Considerations topic">Automated Search Clean Up Considerations</a> prior to using this feature.</p>
                                        <p>Saved Searches are powerful customizations used throughout NetSuite and interconnected to other customizations. As user-created Saved Searches proliferate, NetSuite accounts become inefficient and overall performance degrades. This rules-based tool provides administrators the ability to identify and archive Saved Searches and keep NetSuite accounts organized, easy to understand, and improve efficiency and performance. Archived searches can be restored with <a href="#Limitati">limitations</a>.</p>
