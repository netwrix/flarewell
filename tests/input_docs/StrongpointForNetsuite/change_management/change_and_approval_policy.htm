                                        <p>The Advanced Change Management system uses a set of policy records called  Change and Approval Policies.
These Change and Approval Policies define:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Level of change management required for a given change, for example, modifying a script vs. a search.</li>
                                            <li>Level of approval required</li>
                                            <li>Approvers</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The <a href="setting_up_policies.htm" title="Open the Seting Up Policies topic" alt="Open the Seting Up Policies topic">Setting Up Policies</a> topic has details on setting up the Change / Approval Policies.

</p>
                                        <p>When Process Issues or Change Requests are created, the impacted customizations and processes are analyzed. The change policy that applies is identified based on the IT risk from the Customization Record and the process risk from the Process Records.</p>
                                        <p>

The Change and Approval Policy also determines the change level required for any detected changes to be compliant. This ensures that even changes that do not go through the planned change management process are analyzed against the policy for compliance.
</p>
                                        <p>
For example, a company may have multiple policies. For example:
</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Default Policy</b> applies to any customization or process without a specific policy. Requires scripted changes go through a relatively high level of review compared to non-scripted changes.
</li>
                                            <li><b>Financial Processes Policy</b> applies to the core financial processes. Under this policy, any changes to the financial processes could require full development and testing and approval of the CFO.
</li>
                                            <li><b>Critical Operational Processes Policy</b> applies to vital operational processes or customizations such as those comprising a critical integration. This policy might require approval by the CFO as well as the expert owners of the specific objects concerned.
</li>
                                            <li><b>Controls Policy</b> applies to key reports and controls listed on the policy that need specific approval to modify and ensures there are no changes without a proper audit review.
</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Once in place, the policies remind users of the level of change management required as well as monitors the changes that do occur and raises alerts to IT if there are any change violations. </p>
                                        <p>You can create a custom change request form for a Policy Approval. Refer to <a href="use_custom_cr_forms.htm" title="Open Using Custom Change Request Forms" class="MCXref xref">Using Custom Change Request Forms</a> for information on implementing your custom form.</p>
                                        <div class="toc-macro"/><h2 id="non-material_changes">Non-Material Changes</h2>
                                        <p>Non-material changes are changes detected in objects that are not performed by a human and do not have functional impact.

                                        <p>Here is the criteria for non-material changes:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>

                                                <p>XML changes that do not directly affect the object definition. For example, Script Deployment where it shows all related scripts that are deployed to the same record.</p>
                                            </li>
