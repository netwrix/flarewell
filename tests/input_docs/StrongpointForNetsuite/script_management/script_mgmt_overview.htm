                                        <p>The focus of script analysis can vary based on your business needs. We recommend the following based on the questions you are trying to answer:</p>
                                        <p><b>Which scripts are executing too often or being triggered by the wrong people across the whole account? </b> </p>
                                        <p>This question would require a broader approach and applying audit tags and changing log levels across the account.  However, if you have a large number of locked and hidden scripts, you may be forced to go with a more focused approach due to the limitations mentioned above.  </p>
                                        <p><b>How are my scripts performing in a particular process? </b> </p>
                                        <p>To get a process focused view, you can use the Map Customization Tools to associate bundles and scripts to processes. This enables you to apply audit tags and change log levels for scripts associated with specific processes using the mass update filters.</p>
                                        <p><b>How are particular scripts or bundles performing?</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>In this case you can either add the audit tags and change the log levels manually or filter the mass updates.</p>

                                        <p><span class="mc-variable General.ProductName variable">Platform Governance for NetSuite</span> has the following capabilities to set up script analysis.  We will provide specific ways to use this tools based on your objectives and account set up.</p>
                                        <h2 id="identify_which_scripts_and_how_many_scripts_have_locked_and_hidden_files">Identify which Scripts and how many Scripts have Locked and Hidden Files</h2>
                                        <p>As mentioned above audit tags cannot be added to these files and changing the log levels is moot.  A future bundle will have this search built in, but you can quickly identify and count the number of locked scripts by creating this saved search:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Create a new saved search, type Customization</li>
                                            <li>Add the following criteria:
				<ul><li>Attempt # greater than zero</li><li>Retrieval Error Not Empty</li></ul></li>
                                            <li>You can add Type to the results to see the script type</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Compare this number to the number of scripts in your account (Customizations&gt;Scripting [ensure all filters are cleared]).  If a large proportion of your scripts are locked and hidden, you may want to focus your analysis by changing the log level and adding audit tags to a limited number of scripts.</p>
                                        <p><b>Customization Record</b>:  You can also see if a script file is locked by looking at the Customization record for that script.  On the <b>Scripting</b> tab, check the script file.  If there are options to download or edit the file, the script file is unlocked.</p>
                                        <h2 id="run_mass_updates">Run  Mass Updates</h2>
                                        <p>A core part of the script performance analysis involves the use of audit tags.  These audit tags only provide data when the scripts are in Audit or Debug mode. It is important to switch the scripts over to one of those two levels if appropriate.The Add Audit Tags mass update backs up and then adds start tags to all of your unlocked scripts.  This enables tracking  frequency of execution.  You can manually add end tags for script execution time tracking. <a href="analyzing_script_performance.htm" title="Open Analyzing Script Performance topic" alt="Open Analyzing Script Performance topic">Analyzing Script Performance</a>.</p>
                                        <h2 id="schedule_the_script_utilization_data_update_script">Schedule the Script Utilization Data Update Script</h2>
                                        <p>This scheduled script captures the script execution data such as how many times it was triggered, who used it and how long it took to execute.

                                        <h2 id="track_progress">Track Progress</h2>
                                        <p>You can monitor the progress of the script data collection with <b><span class="mc-variable General.MenuName variable">Strongpoint</span></b> &gt; <b>Script Management</b> &gt; <b>Tagged scripts with No Data</b><br/>The scripts on this list will fall off this search as data is collected. Scripts that remain on this list are not being executed.</p>
                                        <h2 id="review_script_performance_and_error_reports">Review Script Performance and Error Reports</h2>
                                        <p>There are several searches that provide data about script performance and errors. <a href="reviewing_script_performance_errors.htm" title="Open Review Script Performance and Error Reports topic" alt="Open Review Script Performance and Error Reports topic">Review Script Performance and Error Reports</a></p>
                                        <p>Another critical script is the <b>Strongpoint Parse Script Files SS</b> (note there is also an on demand version OD). This reads each unlocked script file to check for changes, updates the documentation and stores an archive copy of any previous version of the code. Once complete it triggers the <b>Strongpoint MakeJoins</b> script to complete the documentation by attaching related fields and saved searches.</p>
