                                    <h3>Endpoint Policy Manager and Specops Deploy Video Transcript</h3>
                                    <p>Hello, everybody and welcome. This is Jeremy Moskowitz, Microsoft MVP, Enterprise Mobility and Founder of PolicyPak Software. In this video, I'm going to show you how Specops Deploy can be benefited by PolicyPak in a cool better together story.</p>
                                    <p>To set the stage here, Specops Deploy is a great piece of software that enables you to actually deliver software, where PolicyPak helps you deliver application settings. Let's see a cool better together story right out of the gate. Let's "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here…" here, and we'll call this "Deploy WinZip using SpecDeploy."</p>
                                    <p>Let's go ahead and let me show you how these guys do their thing. I'm a big fan of this software because it just works so well. Under user side under "Policies," we'll go to "Software Settings" and go to "Specops Deploy / App" here.</p>
                                    <p>There are a couple ways to use this. I'm going to right to "Deployments" here, and I'm going to create a "New deployment." I'm going to specify a "New package…" here, which is a regular, garden-variety "Windows Installer package."</p>
                                    <p>I'm going to pick my "dcsoftwareWinZip-MSI." I'm picking my WinZip MSI here. What's cool about Specops Deploy is that you can target specific users based on conditions. PolicyPak actually has something similar as well, and it's called item-level targeting.</p>
                                    <p>But here in the next screen, I'll go ahead and select that first. We'll select the "Target." The default target is "All users." They have a really great little interface here that lets you specify different "Target criteria." We're not going to go and do any of that right now, but the point of the story is that's available.</p>
                                    <p>We'll go ahead and we'll deploy "WinZip 14.0" to "All users" here. This is a real package. We're really deploying this package. Let's go ahead and close this out, and we'll "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here…" called manage "Manage WinZip using PolicyPak."</p>
                                    <p>What I'm going to do here first is I'm going to deploy Specops first, and that would be item number "2" actually – so deploy first. In Group Policy ordering, the first thing that happens is number 2, and the last thing that happens is number 1. Then we'll manage it using PolicyPak.</p>
                                    <p>Next, we're going to go to user side "PolicyPak/Applications/New/Application" and go ahead and pick our Pak. Now PolicyPak ships with over 100 preconfigured Paks. I've only got a handful of them here just to show you a quick example. This is my standard one, "PolicyPak for WinZip14 and Later," to get started here.</p>

Now PolicyPak ships with over 100 preconfigured Paks. I've only got a handful of them here just to show you a quick example. This is my standard one, "PolicyPak for WinZip14 and Later," to get started here.</p>
                                    <p>We'll just go ahead and set some of our key core settings like deliver "Minimum password length" to "11," and we'll go ahead and we'll "Hide corresponding control in target application" for one setting and we'll "Disable corresponding control in target application" for another setting. We'll also go ahead for "Cameras" and "Disable whole tab in target application."</p>
                                    <p>Now, let's make sure we've got the stage set properly. For all of our "East Sales Users," as soon as Group Policy applies, it's going to first "Deploy WinZip using Specops Deploy" and then "Manage WinZip using PolicyPak."</p>
                                    <p>Let's go over to this machine. This guy is already logged on. He's "eastsalesuser1," so he's ready to go. When Group Policy refreshes – and in this case, I happen to be using "gpupdate" – you can envision the guy logging on for the first time or changing job roles or anything like that. You can see what happens. The Specops Deploy software kicks into high gear.</p>
                                    <p>It's forced to happen in 15 minutes, but we're not going to wait. We're just going to click "Start Now," and it's going to go ahead and install. Now, what has already happened is that in the background, PolicyPak also put its directives there. As soon as WinZip is on there with Specops Deploy, PolicyPak is already managing the application.</p>
                                    <p>There we go. We've gone ahead and downloaded it. The icon should appear in no time flat. Here we go, all success and done there. Let's just do nothing but run it. Go ahead and run "WinZip." Because Specops Deploy deployed the software and PolicyPak managed the software, you can see that we're delivering these important IT security settings.</p>
                                    <p>Even if a user tries to work around it, the very next time the application is launched, PolicyPak is always working reinforcing and redelivering the settings. This is why we love tools like Specops because it gives you the ability to deploy the software, and you can use PolicyPak to then manage the software.</p>
                                    <p>Let's do a more complex example. Over here on this other machine here, I'm logged on as a guy called "westsalesuser1," but I don't want to deploy a regular application. This time, I want to deploy an App-V package. In order to do that, let's go over to my "West Sales Users" and "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here…" and we'll call this "Deploy WinZip using Specops Deploy (AppV)." This one's a little bit different.</p>
                                    <p>What I'm going to do now is I'm going to go over to my user side, "Policies/Software Settings/Specops Deploy/Deployments" and pick a "New deployment." This time my package is going to be an "App-V package," a virtualized package. I'll go over to my "dcsoftwareWinZip-AppVWinZip14_manifest" file. It tells me how much it's going to download, and I'm ready to go.</p>
                                    <p>I'll go ahead and pick my package here, pick my "Target" as "All Users" again. Now that Specops Deploy is deploying the App-V version, here's the best part. You already have the PolicyPak directive that will manage WinZip using Group Policy. What we're going to do is just simply "Link an Existing GPO." We'll pick it, which is the "Manage WinZip using PolicyPak." Make sure the order is right. We want to make sure that the Specops Deploy goes first and managing goes second. That's it.</p>
                                    <p>We'll go ahead and we'll run "gpupdate" on this target computer here. Again, you could just envision the user logging on for the first time or waiting around and getting the directive. At that point, the virtualized application is going to be delivered. I'm using App-V on this target machine. There we go.</p>
                                    <p>We'll click "Start Now," and you can see the "Software changes in progress." We'll give it a minute and wait for it to be done, and then we'll see that it all works out. Alright, we're all completed. Perfect. Just what we wanted. Again, here's the trick. Watch in the lower right-hand corner when I launch "WinZip." When we do this, we see that App-V kicks into high gear. The application is virtualized.</p>
                                    <p>At this point now, this is where you would be in real trouble if you wanted to deploy and manipulate actual important security settings. Because this application is sandboxed, there's really no way for you to deliver the settings to it except if you've got PolicyPak.</p>
                                    <p>The same settings that you've set already to your standard, real-installed apps, they just transfer over perfectly to your virtualized apps. PolicyPak is able to work with App-V, ThinApp and all the major players, including Symantec and even some of the other players like Spoon and Citrix.</p>
                                    <p>Long story short: Specops Deploy to deploy your software, PolicyPak to manage that deployed software. Said another way, if it's important enough to deploy, it's important enough to manage. I hope this gives you a quick feel for how both Specops Deploy and PolicyPak can work better together.</p>
