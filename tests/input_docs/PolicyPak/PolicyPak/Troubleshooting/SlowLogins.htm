                                    <p>The answer to this problem is a little different if you're just starting out with <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Long_Name variable">Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak)</span>, or if you've been a customer for years.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If you've been a customer for years, you should start to ask yourself: "When did this happen, and why now?"</li>
                                        <li>If you're just starting out with <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span>, then these steps will help you out to get close to the goal to determine where the problem is.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Additionally ask yourself:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                                <li>If the problem is simply on ONE or TWO machines, this is not likely something we can dive in, tear apart and make a bug-fix for. </li>
                                                <li>This is NOT likely a <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> problem (even if removing <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> magically "fixes it.")</li>
                                                <li>A single machine or two with a "weird problem" is likely NOT a "<span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> Bug." We'll try, but if the issue is not reproducible with the steps below, there's a low likelihood of us being able to address it.</li>

                                            <p>Am I having a problem with ONE, TWO, MANY or ALL *USERS* or User profiles? </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>For instance, sometimes we see that "When I log on as Jane to Jane's machine, there is a problem. When I log on to Jane on Frank's machine, the problem is absent." </li>
                                                <li>This is NOT likely a <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> problem (even if removing <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> magically "fixes it.") In these cases, you should blow-away the affected User's profile and see if that corrects the issue.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>

                                    <p>Bug fixes / hotfixes for <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> are made for predictable, reproducible unwanted behavior which is different than the intended or documented result. So if you have one or two machines which are crashing or having other problems, we recommend the items in this section anyway; because maybe they could help. </p>
                                    <p>But if the other 99% of your machines are configured in largely the same way, and working just fine… then it's likely some problem with this "just one" machine. And it's somewhat unlikely we will be able to determine what. We recognize that blowing away or resetting someone's computer can be painful; but unless you can reproduce the unexpected behavior on MULTIPLE COMPUTERS, it is unlikely we will be able to reproduce it, and hence, we cannot build you a fix for a single misbehaving computer. </p>
                                    <p>Moving on to slowdowns and weirdness: Almost all problems of slowdowns and weirdness are not usually <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span> bugs or problems; but instead are System-y software like:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Antivirus</li>
                                        <li>Antimalware</li>
                                        <li>Similar system software that would "beat up" <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span>, which then makes it do bad things.</li>
                                        <li>Other kinds of software that would be a problem would be other desktop management software in the same "ballpark" of <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span>, and/or user experience management software and/or other least privilege management software.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Here's a few emails we got back from customers after they had their own "A-ha moment..." around system software "beating up" on <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">Endpoint Policy Manager</span>: </p>
                                    <ul>
