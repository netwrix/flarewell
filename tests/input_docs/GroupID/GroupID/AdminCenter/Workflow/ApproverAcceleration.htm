                                    <h1>Workflow Approver Acceleration</h1>
                                    <p>The workflow approver acceleration feature ensures that no workflow request remains undecided. It automatically accelerates a request to another approver if the current approver does not act on it for a certain number of days.</p>
                                    <p>Let’s assume User A, who is the approver of a workflow, does not approve/deny a request for x number of days. This request will accelerate to User B (first acceleration level), and if User B does not take action for x days, it will accelerate to User
      C (second acceleration level). The request will continue to be accelerated to the maximum level, and if not approved/denied, it will go to the default approver. When no default approver is defined, the request becomes static. A static request is one that is active in <span xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" class="mc-variable GroupID.Product variable">Directory Manager</span> and can be approved or denied by the approver any
      time. It continues to appear in the list of pending requests for the approver(s).</p>
                                    <p>Workflow approver acceleration settings apply to all workflows in the identity store. However, you can exempt individual workflows from it.</p>
                                    <h2>Apply Approver Acceleration<a name="acceleration"></a></h2>
                                    <p>To configure approver acceleration for an identity store, you have to:</p>
