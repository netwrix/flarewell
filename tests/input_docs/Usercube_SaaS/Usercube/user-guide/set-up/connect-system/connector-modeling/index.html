                                                <p>This page is no technical procedure, but rather a guide aiming to give a global view on connectors (with their components and their purpose), in order to help integrators choose the most appropriate way to model the managed system in the form of a connector later inside <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>.</p>

                                            <p>Modeling the connector is a matter of identifying what data you want to get into <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>. You should not retrieve all the data from the managed system, but only two kinds of useful data:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li value="1">data that represents how the authorization system works in the managed system, i.e. data that composes entitlements and their assignments;</li>
                                                <li value="2">data that you want to watch and/or control and/or fulfill.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>The model must take both into account. So both kinds of data must be extracted from the managed system.</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>Let's take an example. An Active Directory manages authorization through group membership (using the user-group paradigm).</p>
                                                <p>So first we need to retrieve both groups and accounts, in order to manage the AD's assignments of entitlements for our users (in the AD language: manage their accounts and group memberships).</p>
                                                <p>Secondly, we want to control attributes such as the name or e-mail of the account, and ensure they are consistent with the correlated identity. Thus these attributes are the second kind of information that we want to retrieve.</p>
                                            </blockquote>

                                            <p>Fortunately, you won't have to design your connector model from scratch. NETWRIX has done a little work ahead, and you are presented here with four model templates that have proven to work so far. Experience shows that most managed systems can be shaped using one or a mix of the following:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>the User model is the most simple model for a connector, where a user is directly associated with a list of entitlements;</li>
                                                <li>the User-Group model represents typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a> mechanisms, where the ability to perform an action is granted through accounts' membership to a specific group (also called role or profile according to the system);</li>

                                                    <br />The design of a model must take into account what is really going on inside the managed system in terms of entitlements, <u>and</u> be flexible enough to express it as roles in the context of the role model. The role model is the universal RBAC/ABAC language used by <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> to express all entitlements.
<br /><br />You don't have to worry about this "role" part right now. It is going to be tackled during single role catalog creation. At this point, you will take a look at the way roles are defined and linked to resources to represent entitlements. But the work starts here, by modeling the resources that exist in the managed system. Some of those resources, such as Active Directory groups, include interesting information about entitlements.
<br /><br />Right now, you can see the connector's model as a precise description of the <u>shape</u> of the technical resources and entitlements of the managed system. And, you can see roles as the higher-order universal <u>language</u> in which entitlements and their assignments are expressed in <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> for all managed systems.
<br /><br /><strong>Connector model and provisioning</strong>:
<br /><br />After defining the useful data that you need to model a given system, you also have to decide what data you need <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> to write to the managed system. <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span> writing to an external system is called provisioning.</p>

<br /><br />Account types make modeling easier, as they bring another level of information about the entitlements they contain. So we can embed more useful information in the model, thanks to an attribute that represents the account type.
<br /><br />In further steps, you will be able to define one resource type per account type and map each one to a role for assignment and provisioning.</p>

                                            <p>The Account-Profile-Transaction model is better suited to represent a system, with the following basic characteristics:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>To be able to perform an action or read a piece of data, a user must be granted one or several <u>transactions</u>. Transactions represent fine-grained entitlements. They can be associated to a type and conditions that restrict their use, such as a maximum per day or a context of validity.</li>
                                                <li>Transactions are not assigned directly to an account, but are <u>packaged into profiles</u>, which are then assigned to accounts, which are owned by users.</li>
                                                <li>Profiles can sometimes be classified into categories representing the sensitivity of the transactions they contain.
<blockquote><p>For example, profile categories can be <code>Privilege Profiles</code> for high privilege transactions on sensitive data, and <code>Technical Profiles</code> for technical transactions related to system administration.</p></blockquote></li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p>Thus you need to create one entity type to represent accounts, one for profiles, and one for transactions.</p>
                                            <p>Each entity type needs to be shaped with properties, chosen according to the data useful for entitlement assignment.</p>
                                            <p>The only sensitive and required properties are those constituting the link between entity types, i.e. the navigation properties representing the packaging of transactions into profiles on the one hand, and the assignment of profiles to accounts on the other hand. You can potentially add a navigation property in the <code>Profile</code> entity type in order to categorize profiles within larger profiles.</p>
                                            <div class="notices note">
                                                <p>Instead of creating as many <code>Profile</code> objects as there are categories of profile, NETWRIX recommends <u>shaping the <code>Profile</code> object with a <code>category</code> attribute</u>. Indeed, a multiple-object model complexifies the addition of new profiles in the future. And as new profiles can be created in the future though, then you must plan for it.
<br /><br />For example, instead of modeling two artificial types of profiles called <code>PP</code> for "Privilege Profile" and <code>TP</code> for "Technical Profile", prefer a single object <code>P</code> that represents all profiles using a specific attribute to differenciate technical from privilege profiles. This way, the model sticks to the real capacity of the technical tool and all use-cases are considered.

                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>For example, you might want to give certain entitlements only to users who have an administrator profile <u>and</u> work in Marseilles.</p>

                                            <p>Thus you need to create one entity type to represent accounts, one for each criterion, and another one to represent the object linking acounts to criteria.</p>

                                            <p>The difficulty of this model is to map everything to roles in the role model. In <span class="mc-variable IdentityManager.Product_Stort_Name variable">Identity Manager</span>'s role model, one assignment is always one role. But in this case, in the managed system, an assignment is a tuple of things.</p>
                                            <p>To map the tuple of things on a role, we have several choices:</p>

                                            </ol>
                                            <p>The flexibility generated by parameters is particularly interesting for roles that incorporate entitlements in a more complex way than application roles. If the information contained in a role is complicated to deduce, then parameters can bring some clarity in the configuration. The objective is always to minimize the number of distinct roles, and the number of roles that are assigned to one given identity.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>We start by renaming the <code>Account</code> object as <code>AD_User</code> and the <code>Group</code> object as <code>AD_Group</code>.</p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p><strong>Step 3: define useful data close to your reality.</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>We shape these objects with the following attributes:</p>
                                            <p>
                                                <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/ConnectorModel_AD.png" alt="AD Example - Step 2" style="box-shadow: none;" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Step 4: ensure that all objects have unique keys.</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Indeed we defined <code>objectGuid</code> as a key for both accounts and groups.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Step 5: ensure the guidelines' enforcement.</strong>
                                            </p>
                                            <p>We could content ourselves with this model. The main benefit of this model is to closely mimic the reality of the AD authorization mechanism. But we'd like to go a bit further, applying a "keep it open to changes" approach.</p>
                                            <p>Observe the similarities between <code>AD_User</code> and  <code>AD_Group</code>. There are many attributes repeating between the two entity types.</p>
                                            <p>We can simplify: prefer a single object <code>AD_Entry</code> that can represent both users and groups. The difference between the two types of object will be made clear via specific properties like <code>objectCategory</code>, <code>member</code> and <code>memberOf</code>.</p>
                                            <p>Beyond avoiding repetition, this makes the model easily adaptable if new elements pop up.</p>
                                            <blockquote>
                                                <p>For example, we could want to include computers or organizational units in the model in the future. Instead of creating two new additional objects <code>AD_Computer</code> and <code>AD_OU</code>, the existing object <code>AD_Entry</code> can represent them both at no additional modeling cost. Even though we could add <code>AD_Computer</code> and <code>AD_OU</code> without merging groups with entries, designing <code>AD_Entry</code> with all these attributes provides the means to add objects without creating new entity types.</p>
