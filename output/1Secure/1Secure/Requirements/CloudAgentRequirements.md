# Netwrix Cloud Agent Software Requirements

**CAUTION:**  You would generally need only one Netwrix Cloud Agent per audited on-premises AD domain. In case you have both Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix 1Secure auditing the same domain, make sure that only one or none of the products has network traffic compression service enabled for any of the audited sources.

For its correct installation Netwrix Cloud Agent needs the following software requirements:

* Windows Server OS (strongly recommended):

  * Windows Server 2022
  * Windows Server 2019
  * Windows Server 2016
  * Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Desktop OS (64-bit):

  * Windows 10
  * Windows 11
* .NET Framework 4.8 and above (in the monitored environment as well)
* Windows Installer 3.1 and above
* Windows PowerShell 3.0 and above

The machine where you plan to deploy the agent must meet the requirements listed below.

| Hardware component | Evaluation, PoC or starter environment | Regular environment (up to 1m Activity Records/day) | Large environment (1-10m Activity Records/day) | XLarge environment (10m Activity Records/day or more) |

## Requirements for outbound communications with a Netwrix Cloud Agent

To review the security incorporated by the agent in your system, examine the target URL in the Configuration.xml file, which is located on the agent host at:

`C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Cloud Agent\AgentCore\ConfigServer\Configuration.xml`

You must also open the outbound TCP port 443 on the server where the Netwrix Cloud Agent resides. See the [Install Agent](../Install/InstallAgent "Install Agent") topic
