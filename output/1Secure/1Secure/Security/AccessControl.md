# Access Control

Netwrix 1Secure is a multi-tenant cloud application. All data is segregated by tenants and access control is enforced.

Only the users who you explicitly add to your organization in Netwrix 1Secure get to see your dashboards in the product. User access is set up using a customer Azure AD account. You can further protect access using Azure AD support for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Thus, when users get deprovisioned from their corporate directories they also automatically lose access to Netwrix 1Secure.

Netwrix employees who have administrative access to the Azure deployment to maintain the application only do so under their own Netwrix corporate accounts and all their activity is audited.
