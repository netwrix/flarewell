# Protocols and Ports Required for Monitoring File Servers

Review a full list of protocols and ports required for Netwrix 1Secure for File Servers.

* Allow outbound connections from the dynamic (1024 - 65535) local port on the computer where Netwrix Cloud Agent resides.
* Allow outbound connections to remote ports on the source and inbound connections to local ports on the target.

Tip for reading the table: For example, on the computer where Netwrix Cloud Agent resides (source), allow outbound connections to remote 389 TCP port. On domain controllers in your domain (target), allow inbound connections to local 389 TCP port.
