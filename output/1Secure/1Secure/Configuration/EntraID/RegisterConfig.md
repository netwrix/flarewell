# App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID

This topic explains how to configure an app in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to audit Microsoft 365 data sources (SharePoint Online, Microsoft Entra ID, and Exchange Online) in Netwrix 1Secure using modern authentication. This app enables secure access to the Netwrix 1Secure cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and other modern APIs.

You have to configure the app in Microsoft Entra ID once, as it can be used to audit multiple Microsoft 365 data sources, including SharePoint Online, Microsoft Entra ID, and Exchange Online.

**NOTE:** It is recommended to register a dedicated app in Microsoft Entra ID for each data source that you want to audit in Netwrix 1Secure. While sharing a single app across multiple data sources is allowed, it may lead to issues such as throttling. For example, if there are too many connections to Microsoft Graph, some connections may be temporarily stopped. Additionally, different data sources may require different permissions and you might not grant all permissions to a single app.

To begin auditing Microsoft 365 data sources, manually register the app for Netwrix 1Secure in Microsoft Entra ID and provide its settings while adding a data source in Netwrix 1Secure.

**NOTE:** A user account with the Global Administrator, Application Administrator, or Cloud Application Administrator role is required to grant admin consent for certain permissions to the registered application.

**NOTE:** Unified audit log must be enabled for a tenant. See the Microsoft [Turn auditing on or off](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-enable-disable?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=microsoft-purview-portal "Turn auditing on or off") article for additional information.
