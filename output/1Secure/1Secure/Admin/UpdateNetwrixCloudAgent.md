# Update Netwrix Cloud Agent

With Netwrix 1Secure, you can both update the version of the agent by installing new agent or using Self-update function. The Self-update saves your time from installing the new version repeatedly, while providing real-time notifications, managing agent schedule, and bulk update option.

During the update process, your activity monitoring will not be disrupted.
