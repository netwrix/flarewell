# Manage Risk Profiles

In Netwrix 1Secure, the Managed Service Provider (MSP) can create risk profiles.  A risk profile consists of a set of risk metrics, each with preconfigured risk thresholds that represent low, medium, and high risk levels for the metric. You cannot add new metrics but you can change the risk thresholds for each metric. A risk metric is a measurable security parameter that helps analyze potential vulnerabilities in an environment, such as disabled computer accounts, stale direct user permission, inactive user accounts, etc. See the  [Manage Risk Metrics](RiskMetrics "Manage Risk Metrics") topic for additional information.

You can assign a risk profile to one or more organizations. This profile examines the nature and level of threats faced by an organization. Once a risk profile is assigned to an organization, you can do the following:

* Generate state-in-time risk reports to get detailed information on specific security aspects of your environment. A separate state-in-time report is generated for each risk metric in the profile. See the [State In Time Risks Reports](../SearchAndReports/StateInTime "State In Time Risks Reports") topic for additional information.
* Analyze risks for your managed organizations on the Risk Assessment Dashboard page. See the [Risk Assessment Dashboard](RiskAssessmentDashboard "Risk Assessment Dashboard") topic for additional information.

**NOTE:** An organization can have only one risk profile assigned to it at a time.
