# Risk Assessment Dashboard

The Risk Assessment dashboard is designed as a diagnostic tool for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and managed organization users to assess and monitor the security posture of an organization. By regularly reviewing this dashboard, you can get a comprehensive view of the security risks for an organization, track risk levels, address vulnerabilities, and ensure that your environment aligns with industry best practices and standards such as NIST.

* If you are a managing organization (MSP) user, this page provides insights for all your organizations.
* If you are a managed organization user, this page displays insights specific to your organization.

On the Risk Assessment dashboard, you can check:

* What are the security risks of this organization? Are they low, medium, or high?
* How has the risk posture changed over time? Has the organization’s security position improved or worsened compared to the previous week, month, or quarter?
* Does your organization's security posture aligns with security frameworks like NIST?

*Remember,* each organization has a risk profile associated with it and the risk analysis of an organization is based on the metrics included in the risk profile. See the [Manage Risk Profiles](RiskProfiles "Manage Risk Profiles") topic for additional information.

Drop-down Menu Filters

The following drop-down menus are available for filtering data:

* Category – Select a category from the drop-down menu. The Risks list is filtered to display risk metrics that belong to the selected category. The risk profile associated with the organization includes risk metrics, and each metric is assigned a category. By default, *All Categories* is selected. Other options are:

  * Enumerated – Risks that are evaluated in numbers or percentages, for example, the number of inactive accounts
  * Boolean – Risks that are evaluated based on a true/false condition. For example, if a third party application is not allowed and the system does not detect any, the risk level will be low. However, if the system detects one, the severity level will be high or medium as configured.
* Filter by keyword – Type a search string in the Filter by keyword field. Risk names containing the string are displayed as you type.

## View the Risks List

The Risk Assessment dashboard provides a list of risks detected for an organization based on the applied filters.

*Remember,* each risk is basically a metric included in the risk profile associated with the organization. See the [Risk Metrics List](Metrics List "Risk Metrics List") topic for details on each of the risk metrics.

Risks are categorized into two types:

* Enumerated – Risks that are evaluated in numbers or percentages, for example, the number of inactive accounts
* Boolean – Risks that are evaluated based on a true/false condition. For example, if a third party application is not allowed and the system does not detect any, the risk level will be low. However, if the system detects one, the severity level will be high or medium as configured.

In the Risks list, the information displayed for each risk varies depending on its type – enumerated or Boolean.
