**NOTE:** The New status changes to Healthy status when the agent finishes collection from the environment. The time frame for a change may be within a minute up to several hours depending on the environment size.

You can also review the agent status while adding the organization. See the [Manage Organizations](Organizations/Overview "Manage Organizations") topic for more information.
