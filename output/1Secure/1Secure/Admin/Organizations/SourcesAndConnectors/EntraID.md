**Step 2 –** Click an organization to define a data source and connector(s) for it. The properties page for the organization is displayed with the Sources tab selected by default.

**Step 5 –** On the Configure source details (Step 2 of 3) pane, specify the following settings:

* Source Group – Specify a name for the group to which the data source will belong. Grouping sources, such as computers, allows them to share a common configuration and makes it easier to manage related sources together.
* Tenant ID – The tenant ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](../../../Configuration/EntraID/RegisterConfig "App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.
* Crawl Source – Toggle this option to ON to enable data collection for the source
* Service Account Entra ID Groups – Specify Microsoft Entra ID groups to exclude their service accounts from billable domain accounts so that they are not audited. To specify a Microsoft Entra ID group, enter its name and click the **Add** icon. To specify multiple Microsoft Entra ID groups, add them one by one.
* Credentials – Displays the crdentials that have already been added, while also providing the option to add new credentials. Netwrix 1Secure uses these credentials to connect to the data source. You can select existing credentials or add new ones. To add new credentials, select **Add new Credentials** from the drop-down menu or click the **Add** icon, then specify the following:

  * Client ID – The client ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](../../../Configuration/EntraID/RegisterConfig "App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.
  * Client Secret – The client secret of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](../../../Configuration/EntraID/RegisterConfig "App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.
  * Download Certificate – For certain connectors, such as SharePoint Online State, authentication requires a certificate instead of a client secret. Download this certificate and then upload it to the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the [Upload a Certificate](../../../Configuration/EntraID/RegisterConfig#Upload "Upload a Certificate") topic for additional information.
  * Display Name – Specify a name you want to show for your credentials. It will be displayed on the Credentials tab of the Managed Organizations page.

**Step 6 –** Click **Next**.

**Step 7 –** The Choose new connector (Step 3 of 3) pane lists three connectors for Microsoft Entra ID. Specify the following:

* Entra ID Activity – Toggle the **Entra ID Activity** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for this connector. With this, you can generate activity reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the [Microsoft Entra ID](../../SearchAndReports/Activity#Microsof "Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.
* Entra ID Logons – Toggle the **Entra ID Logons** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for this connector. With this, you can generate logon reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the [Microsoft Entra ID](../../SearchAndReports/Activity#Microsof "Microsoft Entra ID") topic for additional information.

  * Collect Failed Logons – Select this checkbox to collect the failed logon data for Microsoft Entra ID logon reports.
  * Collect Successful Logons – Select this checkbox to collect the successful logon data for Microsoft Entra ID logon reports.

* Entra ID State – Toggle the **Entra ID State** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for this connector. With this, you can generate state-in-time reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the [State In Time Risks Reports](../../SearchAndReports/StateInTime "State In Time Risks Reports") topic for additional information.
