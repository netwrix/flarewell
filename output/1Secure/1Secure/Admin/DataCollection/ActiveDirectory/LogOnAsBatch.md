However, if you have the Deny log on as a batch job policy defined locally or on the domain level, the local Log on as a batch job policy will be reset. In this case, redefine the Deny log on as a batch job policy through the Local Security Policy console on your computer or on the domain level through the Group Policy Management console.

You can configure this policy via the **Local Security Policy** snap-in or using the Group Policy Management console.
