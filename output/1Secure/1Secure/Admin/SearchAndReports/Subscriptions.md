# Subscriptions

The Subscriptions feature allows Managed Service Providers (MSPs) to schedule certain reports (including Risk Assessment Dashboard reports), send them to specific email addresses automatically, or upload reports to a designated folder in SharePoint Online. This enables MSPs to:

* Carry out reporting obligations with the clients
* Store an audit trail for compliance purposes
