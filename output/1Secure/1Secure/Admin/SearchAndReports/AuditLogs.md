# Generate a Self-Audit Report

Built-in Netwrix 1Secure self-audit allows you to track changes to the product configuration, including connectors, data sources, audit scope and details about it (before-after values). This ensures that the monitoring scope covers all major aspects of your organization.

The self-audit report lists all changes made to an organization since its creation.

**NOTE:** Only a Managed Service Provider can generate this report.

Follow the steps to generate the self-audit report.

**Step 1 –** Navigate to **Configuration** > **Audit Logs**. The Activity Reports page is displayed, with All Self Audit Activity selected in the left pane and the corresponding report displayed on the right.

**Step 2 –** The All Self Audit Activity report is generated for the Netwrix (Parent) organization by default. However, you can select a different organization from the drop-down menu at the top of the left pane to view its All Self Audit Activity report.

**Step 3 –** In this report, a default filter is applied with the following settings:

* Filter = When
* Operator = Greater than or equals
* Value = This field displays the date one week prior to the current date. For example, if today is 01/07/2025, the Value field will display 01/01/2025 12:00 am.

You can apply more filters if required. Select a filter, operator, and value, then click **Search**. The report displays data based on the applied filters.
