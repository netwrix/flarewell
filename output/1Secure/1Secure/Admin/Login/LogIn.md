# First Login to 1Secure

This topic describes how an MSP can access the 1Secure tenant for the first time, activate their account, and complete the initial login. After logging in, the MSP can add users to the tenant and assign them roles based on the required access levels.

When the Netwrix team adds a new user account for your organization, you will receive an email invitation. This email will be sent from "noreply-account@netwrix.com" and will have the subject "Welcome to Netwrix 1Secure".

This email includes a unique access link to product’s web portal. You need to activate your account via the link within 2 days. If it expires, you will need to follow the link and request a new activation link.
