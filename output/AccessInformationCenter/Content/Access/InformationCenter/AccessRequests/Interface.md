# Access Requests Interface

The Access Requests interface opened by the **Access Requests** button on the Access Information Center Home page is where Request Administrators manage the Self-Service Access Requests workflow. The interface has two tabs:

* [Pending Requests Tab](#Pending "Pending Requests Tab") – View pending requests and send reminders to owners
* [Request History Tab](#Request "Request History Tab") – View the audit trail of processed requests

For both tabs the interface also includes:

* Daily Requests line graph
* Resource Types Status donut graph
