The table displays the following information for selected trustee:

* Status – Icon indicates the decision made by the owner on the request: Accepted (green check mark), Declined (red **x**), or Canceled (orange circle with slash)
* Group Name – Name of the group where membership was modified to process the change in Active Directory. Access to File System and SharePoint resources are controlled through Access Groups. See the [Access Groups](../../ResourceOwners/AccessGroups "Access Groups") topic for additional information.
* Update Type – Indicates if group membership was added or removed to process the change
* Member Name – sAMAccountName associated with the domain user whose membership was being changed

**NOTE:** The table data grid functions the same way as other Access Information Center table grids. See the [Data Grid Features](../../../General/DataGrid "Data Grid Features") topic for additional information.
