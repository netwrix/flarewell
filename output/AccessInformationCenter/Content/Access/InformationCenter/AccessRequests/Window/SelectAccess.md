# Select Access Window

The Select Access window opens from the Pending Access Requests Page of the Owner portal and allows you to select an access level different to what has been requested. See the [Pending Access Requests](../Owners/PendingRequests "Pending Access Requests Page") topic for additional information. Follow the steps to grant a different access level.

**Step 1 –** On the Pending Access Requests Page of the Owner portal, select the desired request and click **More Options**. The Select Access window opens.

**Step 2 –** The drop-down menu provides alternative access levels. Options vary based on how the resource was configured for self-service. Select the desired Access Level.

*Remember,* this is only applicable to file system and SharePoint resources. Group membership only has one access level, Membership.

**Step 3 –** Optionally select to only grant temporary access, or change a requested expiration date:

* If only temporary access is required, select the checkbox, click **Set Date** and select an expiration date (or modify an existing date set by the requester).
* The owner also has the option to remove the expiration date by deselecting the temporary access option.

**Step 4 –** Click **Accept** to approve the request with the modified Access Level.

**NOTE:** You can click **Cancel** to close the window without changing the Access Level or approving the request.

**Step 5 –** The Access Information Center starts the action with the status displayed on the Saving request window. When the action completes successfully, click **OK** to close the Saving Request window.

The access has been granted and the requester sent an email notification informing them. The request is visible on the Access Request History Page. See the [Access Request History](../Owners/RequestHistory "Access Request History Page") topic for additional information.
