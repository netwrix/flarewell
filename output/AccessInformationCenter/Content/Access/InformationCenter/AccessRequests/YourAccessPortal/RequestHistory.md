# Request History Page

The Request History page in the Your Access portal is where you can view the status of previously submitted requests, both pending and processed.

![Your Access portal Request History page](../../../../../../../static/Content/Resources/Images/Access/InformationCenter/AccessRequests/YourAccessPortal/RequestHistory.png "Your Access portal Request History page")

The information displayed in the table includes:

* Request Time – Date timestamp when the request was submitted
* Source – Origin of the request or change:

  * User means you submitted the request
  * Owner means the resource owner made the change outside of the Self-Service Access Requests workflow
* Access – Level of access requested. Possible values include:

  * For file system and SharePoint resources: Full Control, Modify, or Read
  * For groups and distribution lists: Membership
* Expiration – If the access is temporary, shows the expiration date:

  * When a user has temporary access already granted to a resource, and then requests a different type of access to the same resource with a different expiration date, once the new access is granted, the new expiration date supersedes the old date.
* Expired – If the access is temporary, shows when the access is expired:

  * If an expiration date is superseded by another request, the previous access type will show a different icon (purple ticket), the tooltip indicates that another request changed the access. In the case that an owner removes a user’s access through ad hoc changes before the expiration date, the removed access will show the superseded icon.
* Notes – Icon indicates a Note has been added. Click on the icon to read the attached note(s).
* Resource Name – The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its location, such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or Group name (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
* Resource Description – Description or explanation of the resource as supplied by either the Ownership Administrator or the assigned owner
* Response Time – Date timestamp when the request was processed
* Decision – Decision made by the owner on the request: Accepted (green check mark), Declined (red x), or Canceled (orange circle with slash). A clock icon indicates the request is still pending.
* Reviewer Name – Name of the owner who processed the request, as read from Active Directory
* Reviewer Title – Position in the company for the owner who processed the request, as read from Active Directory
* Reviewer E-Mail – Email address for the owner who processed the request, as read from Active Directory
* Reviewer Department – Department in the company of the owner who processed the request, as read from Active Directory
