# Pending Access Requests

The Pending Requests tab of the Access Requests page accessed through the Owner portal is where you can view pending requests for your resources.

* Access – Level of access requested. Possible values include:

  * When a user has temporary access already granted to a resource, and then requests a different type of access to the same resource with a different expiration date, once the new access is granted, the new expiration date supersedes the old date.
* Notes – Icon indicates a Note has been added. Click on the icon to read the attached note(s).
* Resource Name – The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its location, such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or Group name (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
* Resource Description – Description or explanation of the resource as supplied by either the Ownership Administrator or the assigned owner
