# Access Request History

The Request History tab of the Access Requests page accessed through the Owner portal is where you can view the request history for your resources.

![Request History tab of the Resource Owners Acces Requests page](../../../../../../../static/Content/Resources/Images/Access/InformationCenter/AccessRequests/Owners/RequestHistory.png "Request History tab of the Resource Owners Acces Requests page")

The information displayed in the table includes:

* Request Time – Date timestamp when the request was submitted
* Trustee Name – Name of the domain user who requested access
* User Title – Position in the company for the domain user who requested access, as read from Active Directory
* User E-Mail – Email address for the domain user who requested access, as read from Active Directory
* User Department – Company department for the domain user who requested access, as read from Active Directory
* User Employee ID – Company department for the domain user who requested access, as read from Active Directory
* Source – Origin of the request or change:
  * Owner means access was changed by the owner through ad hoc changes
  * User means a request was submitted by a domain user
* Access – Level of access requested. Possible values include:

  * For file system and SharePoint resources: Full Control, Modify, or Read
  * For groups and distribution lists: Membership
* Expired – If the access is temporary, shows when the access is expired:

  * If an expiration date is superseded by another request, the previous access type will show a different icon (purple ticket), the tooltip indicates that another request changed the access. In the case that an owner removes a user’s access through ad hoc changes before the expiration date, the removed access will show the superseded icon.
* Expiration – If the access is temporary, shows the expiration date:

  * When a user has temporary access already granted to a resource, and then requests a different type of access to the same resource with a different expiration date, once the new access is granted, the new expiration date supersedes the old date.
* Notes – Icon indicates a Note has been added. Click on the icon to read the attached note(s).
* Resource Name – The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its location, such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or Group name (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
* Resource Description – Description or explanation of the resource as supplied by either the Ownership Administrator or the assigned owner
* Response Time – Date timestamp when the request was processed
* Decision – Decision made by the owner on the request: Accepted (green check mark), Declined (red x), or Canceled (orange circle with slash)
