# Resource Ownership with the Access Information Center

This topic and its subtopics are written for users who have been assigned resource ownership.

Through the Netwrix Access Information Center, an organization can enable business owners and data custodians to manage their resources without direct IT department involvement. You may be granted the ability to make ad hoc changes to access of your resources. If your organization is running Resource Review attestations, you will be expected to complete reviews. If your organization enables Self-Service Access Requests, you will be expected to process requests for your resource.

**NOTE:** For the Access Information Center, a “resource” refers to the file system shared folders, SharePoint sites, Active Directory (AD) groups, AD distribution lists, and/or local Administrators groups.

Your Access Information Center Administrator will let you know what URL to use for logging in as well as what credentials to use. The URL will require you to be connected to your organization's network. Upon login, you will be directed to the Owner portal.
