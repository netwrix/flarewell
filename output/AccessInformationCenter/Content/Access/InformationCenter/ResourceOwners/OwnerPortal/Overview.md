# Owner Portal Overview

The Owner portal is where owners manage their assigned resources. You should log into the Access Information Center with domain credentials. Where it opens is dependent on whether or not you have been assigned a user role beyond owner.

* For an owner with an assigned user role, the Access Information Center will open to the Home page. You will use the **Manage Your Resources** link in the Your Links section to open the Owner portal. If resources assigned to you have pending resource reviews or pending access requests, the Pending Tasks notification displays next to the link.
* For an owner without an assigned user role, the Access Information Center will open directly to the Owner portal.

The Owner portal has three sections:

* [Actions Panel](ActionsPanel "Actions Panel") — provides access to the Resource Reviews and Self-Service Access Requests workflow features

  * Access Requests— Navigates to the Access Requests page where you can view both pending and historical access requests for your resources
  * Reviews — Navigates to the Reviews page where you can view your pending reviews and history of previously reviewed items
  * My Access — Navigates to the Your Access portal where you can submit access requests, view pending requests, and view the history of your access requests
* [Assigned Resources](AssignedResources "Assigned Resources") — A table of assigned resources with action buttons below
* [Ownership Status](#_Ownership_Status "Ownership Status") — Displays a graphical representation of confirmed ownership for assigned resources

## Ownership Status

The Ownership Status section contains a confirmation chart.
