# Owner Confirmation Request Email

The Ownership Administrator may request ownership confirmation for a resource being managed through the Access Information Center. As an assigned owner, you will receive the following email.

The Ownership Confirmation Request email provides buttons for confirming (Yes) or declining (No) ownership of the listed resource. You will be asked to authenticate for your response to be processed. The application will launch in your default browser. Enter your domain credentials to complete the process. One of two messages will appear according to if you confirmed or declined.

## Confirmed Ownership Message

If you have accepted ownership for the assigned resource, the browser will display the following message after authentication:

![Ownership accepted browser message](../../../../../../../static/Content/Resources/Images/Access/InformationCenter/ResourceOwners/EmailResponseConfirmed.png "Ownership accepted browser message")

You have successfully confirmed your ownership and can now close the browser window.

## Declined Ownership Message

If you have declined ownership for the assigned resource, the browser will display the following message after authentication:

![Ownership declined browser message](../../../../../../../static/Content/Resources/Images/Access/InformationCenter/ResourceOwners/EmailResponseDeclined.png "Ownership declined browser message")

Enter your suggestion for possible owners in the textbox, and then click **Submit** to complete the process.
