# Sensitive Content Summary Report

The Sensitive Content Summary report at the **PostgreSQL** node provides a count of databases where criteria matches were found in the targeted environment. This report includes a Details table.

* Path – Location of the table where the criteria matches were found
* Sub File – Column name of where the sensitive data resides
* Count – Number of criteria matches found within each table
