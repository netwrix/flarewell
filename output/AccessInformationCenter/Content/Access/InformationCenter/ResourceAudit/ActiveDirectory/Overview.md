# Active Directory Reports

Active Directory reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the Active Directory resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer .Active Directory Inventory solution and the Access Analyzer Active Directory Permissions Analyzer solution. See the .Active Directory Inventory Solution and the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution topics in the [Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer "Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation") for additional information.

Active Directory resource reports identify the following information in the targeted Active Directory environment:

* How many objects exist across the targeted Active Directory domains
* What changes have been made to users and groups
* What permissions are applied to computers, groups, organizational units, domains, containers, and user objects in Active Directory

The following reports are available at the **Active Directory** node:

* [Domain Summary Report](DomainSummary "Domain Summary Report")
* [Exceptions Report](Exceptions "Exceptions Report")
