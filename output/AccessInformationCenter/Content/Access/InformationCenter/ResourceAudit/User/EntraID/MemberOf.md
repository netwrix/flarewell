# Member Of Report for Entra ID User

The Member Of report for a user object provides a list of all groups of which the audited Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) user is a member. This report includes a Membership Paths table.

This report is comprised of the following columns:

* Domain Name – Name of the domain
* Group Scope – Scope of the group object: Domain Local, Global, or Universal
* Group Target – Not applicable to Entra ID. The value will always be None.

  * Direct – Object is specifically assigned to this group
  * Nested – Object is a member of a group which has membership in this group
* Description – Description of this group from Entra ID

Since this report is a list of Entra ID groups, the Group Membership pane displays the group membership, including nested groups.
