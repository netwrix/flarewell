# User Reports

User reports are accessed through the User Audit interface. You can access User reports by searching for user objects on the Home page. See the [Search Features](../Navigate/Search "Search Features") topic for additional information. The user object being reviewed is identified in the upper-left corner. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer solutions which provide data to the Resource reports. See the desired solution topic of the [Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer "Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation") for additional information.

User reports identify the following information as scanned from the targeted environments:

* Everywhere a particular user has access
* What is that user doing with the access
* What Active Directory or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) permissions are applied to the user object

Activity reports display information for a selected date range. Some of the reports also include trend graphs. Trend graphs provide a visual representation of the activity that occurred over the selected date range. See the [Activity Report Results Pane Features](../Navigate/Overview#Activity "Activity Report Results Pane Features") topic for instructions on selecting a date range and filtering the trend graphs. Activity reports display local time stamps. Activity information is represented in two ways:

* Activity Statistics – Statistics reports show the count of operation events performed for the selected resource within the selected date range. These events are normalized into the operations of Reads, Writes, Deletes, and Manages.
* Activity Details – Details reports show the specific operation events that occurred for the selected resource within the selected date range
