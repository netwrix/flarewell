# Sensitive Content Details Report

The Sensitive Content Details report at the Organization level provides a count of files where criteria matches were found on the selected instance. This report includes a table with criteria Matches visible to Access Information Center users with either Security Team Member or Administrator roles. The Matches table requires the storage of discovered sensitive data within the Access Analyzer database or it will be blank.

* Match – Lists any sensitive data matches found for the highlighted criteria in the top grid of the report
* Suffix – Text just after the sensitive data match in the file
* Sub File – File name if the sensitive data files reside in a PST file or a ZIP file
