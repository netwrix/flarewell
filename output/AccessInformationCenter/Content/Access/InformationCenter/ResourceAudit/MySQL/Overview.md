# MySQL Reports

MySQL reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the MySQL resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer MySQL solution. See the MySQL Solution topic in the [Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer "Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation") for additional information.

A single MySQL Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its own node in the Access Information Center. MySQL reports fall into the following categories:

* Permissions reports
* Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **MySQL** node:

* [Sensitive Content Summary Report](SensitiveContentSummary "Sensitive Content Summary Report")
