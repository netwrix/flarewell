An exception is defined as a problem or risk to data governance security. Exceptions include open access and permissions granted to stale or disabled users. This table will be blank if no exceptions were found within the targeted farm/instance. This report is comprised of the following columns:

* Server Name – Single server name representing the entire SharePoint on-premise farm or SharePoint Online instance
* Name – Type of exception found
* Description – Description of the exception type
* Count – Number of this type of exception found on the farm/instance

There is one table at the bottom displaying Details for the selected exception:

* Trustee Name – Owner of the trustee account
* Path – Location of the resource where the exception exists
