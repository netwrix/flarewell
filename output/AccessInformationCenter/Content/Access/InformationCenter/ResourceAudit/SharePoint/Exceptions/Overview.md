# Exceptions Node Report

The following report is available at the **Exceptions** node:

* [Exceptions Report](Exceptions "Exceptions Report")

The Exceptions node displays when exceptions have been identified on the selected farm/instance. When it is present, it can be expanded to view the exception type level reports. The following nodes may show under the Exceptions node for a SharePoint resource when that exception type has been identified:

* Disabled Users – Site collections, sites, libraries, lists, or folders where disabled users have been granted access
* Open resources – Site collections, sites, libraries, lists, or folders that are openly accessible
* Stale Users – Site collections, sites, libraries, lists, or folders where stale users have been granted access
* Unresolved SID – Site collections, sites, libraries, lists, or folders where the trustee is an unknown SID, not matched to a known trustee account within Active Directory for on-premise farms or Entra ID for online instances, have been granted access

The Exceptions report for each exception type level displays filtered exception information. See the [Exceptions by Type Report](ExceptionsByType "Exceptions by Type Report") topic for the report details.
