# SQL Server Reports

SQL Server reports are accessed through the Resource Audit interface. Explore the SQL Server resources by expanding the levels within the Resources pane and selecting the desired resource. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer SQL solution. See the SQL Solution topic in the [Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer "Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation") for additional information.

A single SQL Server can have multiple instances. Each instance where data is collected has its own node in the Access Information Center. SQL Server reports fall into the following categories:

* Permissions reports
* Activity reports
* Sensitive Data Content reports

The following report is available at the **SQL Server** node:

* [Sensitive Content Summary Report](SensitiveContentSummary "Sensitive Content Summary Report")
