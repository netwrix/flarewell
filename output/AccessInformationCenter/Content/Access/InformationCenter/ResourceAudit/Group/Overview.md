# Group Reports

Group reports are accessed through the Group Audit interface. You can access Group reports by searching for group objects on the Home page. See the [Search Features](../Navigate/Search "Search Features") topic for additional information. The group object being reviewed is identified in the upper-left corner. The data within these reports is collected by the Access Analyzer solutions which provide data to the Resource reports. See the desired solution topics in the [Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/accessanalyzer "Netwrix Access Analyzer Documentation") for additional information.

Group reports identify the following information as scanned from the targeted environments:

* Everywhere a particular group has access
* What trustees are members of a particular group
* What group membership changes have occurred
* What Active Directory or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) permissions are applied to the group object

Changes reports display information for a selected date range.

Built-in group reports are opened through a search conducted for any of the following groups:

* Network Configuration Operators
* Server Operators
* Print Operators
* Backup Operators
* Cryptographic Operators
* Account Operators

**NOTE:** The Members report for a built-in group contains different information than the other group types. See the [Members Report for a Built-in Group](MembersBuiltin "Members Report for a Built-in Group") topic for additional information.
