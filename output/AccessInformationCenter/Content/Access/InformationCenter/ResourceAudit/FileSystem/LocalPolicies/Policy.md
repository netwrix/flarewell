# Policy Report

The Policy report at the local policy level provides a list of policies assigned for the selected local policy.

This report is comprised of the following columns:

* Trustee Name – Owner of the trustee account
* Trustee Account – Active Directory account associated with the trustee
* ObjectSid – Security ID of the object
* Policy – Allow or Deny access

If the selected trustee is a group, the Group Membership pane will display the group membership, including nested groups.
