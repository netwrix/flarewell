You are an expert assistant trained on the full taxonomy of MadCap Flare documentation and every Docusaurus Markdown convention. Your mission is to help build (and continuously improve) an open-source Python tool that converts Flare content into Docusaurus-compatible Markdown.
You possess deep, practical knowledge of:

* **Flare source structure & semantics** – `.flprj`, `.fltoc`, `.flvar`, `.flsnp`, condition tags, variables, snippets, TOC hierarchies, output targets, cross-references, styles, and any other project artifacts.
* **Flare output formats** – HTML5, XHTML, PDF. You know how to extract fully-resolved topic content, variables/conditions, image paths, and cross-topic links from each.
* **Markdown & Docusaurus specifics** – GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), MDX, YAML front-matter, admonitions (`:::note` etc.), sidebar configuration (`sidebar_position`, `sidebars.js`), asset handling, versioning strategy, and the wider plugin ecosystem.
* **Python tooling** – libraries such as `html_to_markdown`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pypandoc`, plus best-practice patterns for clean, maintainable conversion pipelines and CI validation.

**Output requirements**

* Produce **clean, validated Markdown** with correct front-matter, working internal links, accurate sidebar metadata, and properly relocated images/assets.
* Support **both** direct conversion from Flare source files (**`.flprj` / `.fltoc`**) **and** post-generated XHTML exports.
* Ensure every deliverable builds flawlessly in a Docusaurus site (lint, local build, optional CI check).

**When converting a topic, always:**

1. **Resolve all conditions & variables** before or during extraction.
2. **Transform Flare-specific UI constructs** (notes, expandable text, callouts, etc.) into the equivalent Docusaurus Markdown patterns (e.g., `:::note`).
3. **Preserve TOC hierarchy & order** via `sidebar_position` or generated `sidebars.js`.
4. **Rewrite internal links & image references** to match the new Markdown file layout.
5. **Place static assets** in their proper locations (`static/` or co-located folders).
6. **Validate** using Markdown lint rules, a local Docusaurus build, and (where configured) CI workflows.

Your overarching goal: **deliver high-fidelity Markdown optimized for Docusaurus with full automation and minimal post-conversion cleanup.**

Great. I’ll investigate the full taxonomy of a MadCap Flare project and its HTML5 output—including source structure, content organization, variables, snippets, conditions, TOC, and how these can be translated into Docusaurus-compatible Markdown. I’ll get back to you shortly with a comprehensive breakdown.


# MadCap Flare Project Structure and Conversion to Docusaurus Documentation

## Overview of Flare Project Organization

MadCap Flare organizes content into a **project** comprising two main directories by default: a **Content** folder for source content files and a **Project** folder for project configuration files. At the root of the project is an XML project file (`.flprj`) that defines global project settings. All Flare files use XML format (often XHTML for topics) – Flare projects are entirely open and editable as XML. This structure enables easy parsing and conversion since every topic, TOC, snippet, etc., is an XML document.

* **Content Folder:** Contains all authoring assets such as **topics**, **snippets**, **images**, and **stylesheets** (CSS). Authors can organize this folder into any subfolder hierarchy needed (e.g. grouping topics by section or feature).
* **Project Folder:** Contains supporting project files like **table of contents** (TOC) definitions, **target** files, **skin** files (for HTML templates/UI), **condition tag sets**, **glossaries**, etc. These are managed in Flare’s *Project Organizer*. (Flare also creates auxiliary folders like **Output** for generated output, and others for analysis and source control cache, but these do not contain source content.)

**Flare Project File Types:** The table below summarizes key file types in a Flare project and how each is used:

| **File Type**          | **Extension**  | **Description and Role**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Topic files**        | `.htm` (XHTML) | **Topics** are the primary content files. Each topic is a standalone, XML-based XHTML file containing text, headings, images, and links about a specific subject. Topics are the modular building blocks of the documentation (analogous to pages or articles).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Table of Contents**  | `.fltoc`       | **TOC files** define the navigation hierarchy. A TOC XML file contains a tree of `<TocEntry>` elements with *Title* and *Link* attributes pointing to topics or nested TOCs. This controls the structure and sequence of topics in outputs (for online help navigation or print order). Flare projects can have multiple TOCs (e.g. one per output or language), all stored under the Project > TOCs folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Snippet files**      | `.flsnp`       | **Snippets** are reusable content fragments (chunks of formatted XML content). A snippet might be a paragraph, a formatted note box, a table, or any combination of elements that is reused in multiple topics. Snippet files are stored typically in Content > Resources > Snippets. Authors insert them into topics, allowing single-sourced updates: editing the snippet file updates all topics that include it. In the XML, an inserted snippet appears as a reference element (e.g. `<MadCap:snippetBlock src="...">` for block-level snippets) rather than duplicating content in each topic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Variable sets**      | `.flvar`       | **Variables** are placeholders for text (product names, version numbers, etc.) that may change or be output-specific. Variables are defined in Variable Set files (`.flvar`) stored under Project > Variables. A variable set contains multiple named variables each with a definition (value). Authors insert variables into topics (as small XML spans or markers) instead of literal text. When generating output, Flare replaces these with the current definition. Flare even allows multiple definitions per variable for different targets (e.g. a `ProductName` variable might have “Pro” for one target and “Lite” for another) – the target configuration picks which value to use.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Condition tag sets** | `.flcts`       | **Condition tags** support conditional text for single-sourcing. A condition tag set file lists named condition tags (often organized by category). Authors can apply these tags to content spans, blocks, or entire topics to mark them for inclusion/exclusion in specific outputs. In the XML, conditioned content is wrapped in a `<MadCap:conditionalText>` element with a `MadCap:conditions` attribute naming the tag(s). Each target defines which condition tags are included or filtered out during generation. This allows one Flare project to produce variants of documentation (e.g. “Basic” vs “Advanced” features, or platform-specific content) from the same source.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **File tag sets**      | `.flfts`       | **File tags** are arbitrary metadata tags that can be applied to files (topics, etc.) for organizational purposes. For example, a team might tag topics with “Draft” or assign authors or milestones. These tags do not affect the output content; they are primarily for project management and can be ignored during conversion to Markdown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Target files**       | `.fltar`       | **Targets** define output *publishing configurations*. A target file is essentially a recipe for building a specific output (e.g. *HTML5 Help*, *PDF*, *Clean XHTML*, etc.). Each target specifies the output format and options like which master TOC to use, which condition tags to include/exclude, which variable set values to apply, the selected skin (for HTML outputs), and other output-specific settings. In Flare’s UI, targets are listed under Project > Targets. For example, an HTML5 target might reference the “Online_Help.fltoc” TOC, include only “Platform=Web” conditional content, use the “Responsive” skin, and apply certain variable overrides. In essence, *Targets = output configuration files*. (One often-used target type is **Clean XHTML**, which produces simplified static HTML output of topics without the full HTML5 navigation system.) |
| **Skin files**         | `.flskn`       | **Skins** define the look-and-feel of the output’s UI chrome for online outputs. For HTML5 outputs, a skin might control navigation style (side-nav, top-nav, tri-pane), toolbar buttons, colors, etc. Skins are stored under Project > Skins and are XML files. When generating output, Flare uses the skin settings to produce the necessary HTML/CSS/JS framework around the content. (For conversion to Docusaurus, skin files are not directly used, since Docusaurus will handle navigation UI.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Stylesheets (CSS)**  | `.css`         | Flare uses standard CSS stylesheets to control content styling. These appear in the Content folder (often under Resources > Stylesheets). Flare may have multiple CSS files for different purposes: a **regular stylesheet** for general content (headings, paragraphs, etc.), a **table stylesheet** for table-specific classes, and perhaps a **branding stylesheet** for product-specific branding elements. All topics link to one or more of these CSS files (Flare manages these links via the Project settings or Master Pages). During conversion, the CSS can be carried over or translated to Docusaurus theme custom CSS as needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Additional file types:** Flare projects can include other files such as **glossaries** (`.flglo` for lists of terms and definitions), **index** files, **TOC browse sequences** (`.flbrs`), **relationship tables** (`.flrtb` for linking related topics), **search filter sets** (`.flsfs` for defining filters on search), and **master pages**/page layouts for print outputs. These all reside in the Content or Project folders as appropriate. For the scope of conversion to Docusaurus (a static site generator focusing on topics and navigation), the primary concern is topics, TOCs, reusable content (snippets/variables), media, and conditions as outlined above.

## Internal Structure of Topics and Fragments

Each **topic (`.htm`) file** in Flare is essentially a well-formed XHTML document. It typically includes a `<head>` (with metadata like topic title, keywords, etc.) and a `<body>` containing the content. The body holds the text, which can include standard XHTML elements (`<p>`, `<h1>...<h6>`, `<ul>/<ol>` lists, tables, `<img>` for images, etc.) as well as Flare-specific XML extensions in the MadCap namespace for certain features. For example:

* **Cross-references:** Flare distinguishes *cross-references* (dynamic links that auto-fetch the target title or other text) from normal hyperlinks. In the XML, a cross-reference is represented by a `<MadCap:xref>` element (in the `MadCap` namespace) with an `href` to the target topic or bookmark. The link text may be generated via a format setting. For instance, a cross-reference might appear as:

  ```xml
  <MadCap:xref href="../Guide/Installing.htm">See "Installing" on page 12</MadCap:xref>
  ```

  In this example, the cross-ref points to *Installing.htm* (using a relative path) and the inner text “See ‘Installing’ on page 12” is automatically generated by Flare’s cross-reference format settings. In many cases (especially for online outputs), Flare’s default cross-reference format is just the target topic’s title or heading text. In any case, the underlying output will be a standard hyperlink `<a>` tag. For conversion, these `<MadCap:xref>` elements need to be turned into Markdown links, using the appropriate link text (usually the topic title or heading).

* **Images:** Images in topics are inserted as regular HTML `<img>` tags with a relative path source. For example: `<img src="Resources/Images/archDiagram.png" alt="Architecture diagram">`. The image files (PNG, JPEG, etc.) are stored in the Content folder (often under a dedicated Images or Resources subfolder). Flare keeps image references relative to the project, which ensures they resolve correctly in output. When Flare builds output, it copies these images to the output directory maintaining the folder structure (unless configured otherwise). In conversion, these become Markdown images (e.g. `![Alt text](../Resources/Images/archDiagram.png)`) or can remain HTML `<img>` tags in MDX – the key is to preserve correct relative linking and include the image files in the Docusaurus project.

* **Media (videos, multimedia):** Flare topics may include multimedia by embedding HTML5 video/audio tags or via Flare’s YouTube/Vimeo widgets. For local videos, Flare would copy the media file into the output. These are relatively infrequent in documentation projects; if present, they can be handled by converting to equivalent MDX (for example, using an HTML `<video>` tag or an iframe for YouTube in the Markdown). Ensure the media file is placed in Docusaurus’s static folder and the link updated.

* **Drop-downs and togglers:** Flare allows interactive content like drop-down text (clickable headings that show/hide content) via *Dropdown* or *Expanding Text* controls. In the XML, a drop-down is typically represented by a `<MadCap:dropDown>` element containing a *DropDownHead* and *DropDownBody*. For instance, a simplified representation might be: `<MadCap:dropDown><MadCap:dropDownHead>Hint</MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody>...hidden content...</MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown>`. Such structures don’t have a direct Markdown equivalent. In conversion, a best practice is to either **convert them to static content** (always visible, perhaps preceded by a bold heading “Hint:”) or use an HTML `<details><summary>` block in MD, which provides similar functionality in a static site. The decision would depend on whether preserving the toggle behavior is important. (Docusaurus supports MDX, so including a `<details>` HTML block is feasible if interactivity is desired.)

* **Snippet references:** When a snippet is inserted into a topic, Flare does **not** duplicate its content in the topic file; instead it places a reference tag. There are two forms: `<MadCap:snippetBlock>` for block-level snippets (inserted on their own line) and `<MadCap:snippetText>` for inline snippets (inserted within a paragraph text flow). These elements have an attribute (like `src` or `MadCap:href`) pointing to the snippet’s `.flsnp` file. For example, a block snippet reference might look like: `<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Note.flsnp" />`. When previewing or building, Flare merges the snippet content at that location. In conversion, the strategy must be to **resolve snippet references** by reading the snippet file and injecting its content into the MD file (to avoid broken links). Snippet files themselves are XML fragments – effectively mini-topics that often contain a sequence of block elements (or sometimes just a single paragraph or table). They may also include their own references to images or even other snippets (nesting is possible). A reliable converter should recursively resolve snippet references to produce a single consolidated Markdown file for each topic.

* **Variables in topics:** Flare variables appear in the topic XML as small empty elements or text tokens that reference a variable name. While the Flare XML editor visually shows the variable’s name or value as a marker, the underlying XML might use a syntax like a span with a data attribute or a MadCap-specific tag. (For example, older versions used an `MadCap:variable` element or a syntax like `{VariableName}` inside text – the exact XML representation can vary by Flare version and is often handled behind the scenes.) Regardless of how they appear, when generating, Flare will replace those with the actual value. For conversion, one should replace variables with their defined value *for the chosen target*. If the project has multiple variable sets or definitions per target, use the value from the appropriate target’s context. For example, if a topic says “Welcome to \[ProductName]”, and `ProductName` is a variable, and for the “User Guide” target the value is “SuperApp Pro 2025”, the Markdown should contain “Welcome to SuperApp Pro 2025”. Essentially, perform a find-and-replace using the `.flvar` definitions for all variables.

## HTML5 Output Structure and Relation to Source

When Flare builds an **HTML5 output**, it generates a set of files that mirror the source content structure plus additional output-specific assets. By default, the output for each target is placed under the project’s `Output` folder, in a subdirectory named after the target (with a further subfolder for the user’s name, if using default settings). For example, if the project is in `C:\MyProject` and the target is “Online_Help”, the HTML5 output might be generated to `C:\MyProject\Output\<Username>\Online_Help\`. This target output folder contains all the files that need to be deployed for that help site.

Key characteristics of HTML5 output structure:

* **Content files:** Flare will produce a standalone HTML file for each topic that is included in the output (usually all topics referenced in the target’s TOC, plus any linked via cross-references or search unless explicitly excluded). By default, Flare preserves the **Content folder structure** in the output (this is configurable; authors can choose to “flatten” the output by not including the Content folder, but typically the structure is retained). For instance, if topics were organized in `Content\Guide\Intro.htm`, the output may contain an `Intro.htm` in a corresponding `Content/Guide/` folder (or just `Guide/` folder, depending on settings). This 1:1 mapping is helpful: you can trace an output HTML file back to its source `.htm`. The filenames remain the same as the source (unless you used Flare’s target setting to rename outputs). All embedded content like images are copied into the output in their relative paths. **Bottom line:** each Flare topic becomes an HTML page in the output site, with the same name and a similar folder path.

* **Main entry file:** HTML5 outputs typically include a *start page*, often named `index.htm` or `Default.htm` at the root of the output (target folder). For *Top Navigation* or *Side Navigation* HTML5 outputs, this might be an index page that loads the initial content (sometimes the default topic) along with the navigation menu. In older *Tri-pane* outputs, the start page was a frameset or script that loads the TOC, index, etc. Modern HTML5 outputs (Top/Side nav) are frameless; they usually include a built navbar on each page or load navigation via scripts.

* **Output support directories:** Flare generates additional directories like **Data**, **Resources**, **Skin**, etc., in the output.

  * The **Data** folder contains XML/JSON files used by the output’s script for dynamic elements. For example, `Data/Toc.xml` (or sometimes `Data/TOCs/YourTOC.xml`) contains the structured TOC data derived from the project’s `.fltoc` file. Similarly, `Data/Search.xml` or `Search.json` might contain pre-built search indexes, and `Data/Glossary.xml` the glossary terms, etc. These data files allow the JavaScript in the HTML5 output to build menus and search results on the fly in the browser. Docusaurus, by contrast, will not use these files – it generates its own navigation and search indexes – so they are not needed when converting.
  * The **Skin** (or **Scripts**/**Styles**) folder holds the styling and scripts for the output’s user interface. Flare will bundle the CSS (both from your stylesheets and skin styles) and necessary JS (for toggling menus, search functionality, etc.). For example, you might see files like `Skin/style.css`, `Skin/MasterPage.css`, or a `Skin.js`, along with icon images or fonts for the webhelp toolbar. These ensure the Flare output has the expected look and feel. In migrating to Docusaurus, these UI artifacts aren’t directly used (since Docusaurus has its own CSS/JS), but **if you have custom CSS for content** (beyond basic styling), you may need to carry some of those styles into Docusaurus’s custom CSS.
  * A **Resources** folder in output might contain other assets (depending on how Flare was configured). Often, *Resources* might hold theme files or additional libraries. In some outputs, user images might be in `Content/Resources` vs. a separate images folder; Flare will replicate that structure.

* **Relationship to source files:** There is generally a direct correspondence – each source topic (.htm) yields an output .htm file. The TOC XML in output is generated from the source .fltoc. For instance, every `<TocEntry>` in the source TOC becomes a node in the output’s Toc.xml (with resolved links to .htm output files). If a source TOC linked to another child TOC or a whole directory of topics, the output will have merged those into one navigation structure.

* **Search and index:** If the Flare project had index markers or search filter tags, Flare’s build will compile those into index files (for example, an `Index.xml` or similar in the Data folder). Docusaurus has its own search (usually through Algolia or client-side indexing of content) and doesn’t use a precompiled index file, so these would not be migrated as-is. Instead, the content conversion must ensure that any **index-like information** (like keywords or tags) are either embedded in the content or annotated in frontmatter if needed for search. Often, it’s acceptable to rely on Docusaurus’s full-text search, but if the project had carefully curated search **filters** (Flare’s search filter sets), you might emulate those by tagging content and using a custom search plugin on Docusaurus.

In summary, Flare’s HTML5 output is a fully functional static website closely mirroring the source project’s structure: all source content (after applying snippets, variables, conditions) is present as HTML pages, and supplemental files (TOC, scripts, styles) enable the interactive help system. **For conversion to Docusaurus, it’s usually best to work from the Flare source** rather than the output, because the source retains the semantic markers (snippets, variables, conditions) that need processing. However, understanding output structure is useful: it validates that each topic stands alone as an HTML page and shows how the TOC and links resolve.

*Tip:* Flare offers a special target type *“Clean XHTML”* which generates each topic as a simplistic, full HTML file without the extra menu scripts (essentially just the topic content in a basic HTML page). Some conversion workflows use Clean XHTML output as the starting point for Markdown conversion, since those files have all snippets and variables already resolved and contain minimal Flare-specific markup. The downside is you lose some structure information (e.g., which parts were conditional or snippet boundaries – they are merged in output). If starting from raw source, you will perform those merges yourself, which gives you more control.

## How Flare Handles Navigation (TOC) and Single-Sourcing

Flare is built for single-sourcing, meaning you can produce multiple outputs (help center, PDF manual, etc.) from one source by using structures like TOCs, conditions, and targets:

* **Table of Contents (TOC):** Flare’s TOC files (`.fltoc`) define *hierarchical navigation*. Each TOC is an XML file with a root `<CatapultToc>` element containing nested `<TocEntry>` elements. Each `<TocEntry>` typically has a `Title` attribute (the label shown in nav) and a `Link` attribute pointing to a topic file or other file. For example:

  ```xml
  <CatapultToc Version="1">
    <TocEntry Title="Introduction" Link="/Content/Guide/Intro.htm" />
    <TocEntry Title="User Guide" Link="/Project/TOCs/UserGuide.fltoc"></TocEntry>
    <TocEntry Title="FAQ" Link="/Content/FAQ.htm" />
  </CatapultToc>
  ```

  In this snippet, the first entry links directly to a topic, the second entry links to another TOC (allowing TOC merging), and the third to a topic again. Flare supports **nested TOCs**: an entry can reference another .fltoc, which gets merged into the parent TOC at that point (there’s even a property to *merge in* the child TOC’s nodes in place of the parent node if desired). Flare’s TOC entries can also point to *external* resources (like a URL or a PDF) or even a *Flare target* (which in output becomes a link to another output). In practice, most entries link to topics or serve as headings (a TocEntry with no Link is just a category heading in the menu).

  The *navigation hierarchy* in the output is built from the TOC. For HTML5 outputs, the TOC provides the structure of menus (side navigation tree or top dropdown menus). For print outputs (like PDF), the TOC order defines the chapter/section ordering and can generate a table of contents page and PDF bookmarks.

  **Mapping to Docusaurus:** Docusaurus uses a *sidebar configuration* (often a JavaScript or JSON file named `sidebars.js`) to define the navigation tree for docs. We will extract the Flare TOC structure and convert it into Docusaurus sidebar format. Typically, each Flare `TocEntry` that links to a topic becomes a sidebar link item, and entries that served as containers (folders with child entries and maybe no direct link) become sidebar categories. Docusaurus supports nested categories, so the hierarchy can be preserved. For example, a Flare book (non-clickable heading) with children would become a Docusaurus category with those children as items. If a Flare TOC entry both has content *and* children (a book that is also a link), one approach is to treat the parent as a category and also include the linked topic as the first item under it (or use the special Docusaurus ability to have a category with an *index* page). We will ensure the sidebar *order and nesting* mirror the Flare TOC so the documentation structure remains the same.

* **Conditional text:** Flare’s condition tags allow fine-grained filtering of content for different outputs. Authors can apply condition tags to pieces of content (down to a phrase or image), entire paragraphs/sections, *or entire files*. For example, a paragraph might be tagged “EnterpriseOnly” to include it only in an Enterprise edition output. In the XML, such a span would be wrapped like: `<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="EnterpriseOnly">This feature is enterprise-only.</MadCap:conditionalText>`. If multiple conditions apply, the attribute can list them (Flare treats it essentially as OR by default, unless using advanced “AND” expressions via tag combinations). In Flare’s target settings, you choose which conditions to include or exclude. Any excluded content is completely omitted from that target’s output.

  Flare’s *single-sourcing strategy* often combines conditions with multiple targets: e.g. one project can maintain **one set of topics** that document both *Product A* and *Product B*, using condition tags “ProdA” and “ProdB” on relevant content, and then two targets build two outputs (one including only ProdA content, one ProdB). Similarly, print vs web differences (like “PrintOnly” sections) can be handled via conditions. Condition tags can also apply to whole topics or TOC entries – you can mark a topic file with a condition (via File Properties), so that if that condition is excluded, the topic is omitted from output (and any TOC entries linking to it might be dropped). In practice, Flare uses condition tags on TOC entries to hide them in certain outputs (this might not be an explicit attribute in the .fltoc XML, but Flare’s build process knows to skip those entries when generating the output TOC file).

  **Mapping to Docusaurus:** Docusaurus does not have a native conditional text feature for building variants of the site – typically, you would maintain separate versions or use React components logic if truly needed. Therefore, for a given static site, we will choose one configuration of content. In other words, decide upfront which conditions’ content should be included. This will likely correspond to one of the Flare targets. The converter should be run in the context of a specific target or conditional profile. All content *not* meant for that output must be filtered out during conversion (excluded). Content that is included can have the condition markers removed (since in a single static site they no longer serve a purpose once the filtering decision is made). For instance, if converting the “Online Help” target and it excludes “PrintOnly” content, the converter will drop any `<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="PrintOnly">...</MadCap:conditionalText>` sections entirely. If some content has multiple condition tags and the target includes one but not the other, apply the logical combination as Flare would. Essentially, implement the same filtering rules as the Flare target.

  If there is a need to maintain **multiple outputs** (say HTML and PDF) using Docusaurus, you might handle this by maintaining multiple versions of the site or using Docusaurus’s versioning or multi-instance approach – but that’s outside the core conversion (the straightforward path is one Docusaurus site per Flare target).

* **Variables in single-sourcing:** As noted, Flare variables can have different values per target (e.g. a single source that outputs for USA vs UK might have a “TaxRate” variable value differ). In Flare’s Target Editor, on the Variables tab, you can override any variable’s definition. The converter needs to respect that: if we convert using the “UK” target, we should replace variables with UK values. A robust converter might actually read the `.fltar` XML (which likely includes sections for overridden variable values and condition include/exclude lists) to automate this. The Flare target file is XML (though not publicly documented in detail) – it contains child elements or attributes defining the selected TOC, the skin, and conditions/variables. By parsing it, one could get the active variable set and any overrides.

* **Snippets and reuse:** Snippets serve single-sourcing by letting you maintain one copy of repetitive content. For conversion, after we merge snippet content into the topics, we end up with fully expanded topics (which is fine for static site output, albeit losing the single-point-update capability). There is no direct analog to Flare snippets in static Markdown, except using MD includes or templates, but Docusaurus does not natively support content inclusion by reference (aside from manual React components). Thus, the safest path is to inline all snippet content. (If maintainability of duplicate content post-conversion is a concern, one could devise a scheme using MDX components or partials, but that gets complex and is usually not required unless the content will continue to be maintained in Markdown.)

* **TOC and multi-TOC single sourcing:** Flare allows multiple TOCs which can even *link* to each other or be merged. For example, a parent product TOC might include a child product’s TOC. If your Flare target uses a single master TOC (even if it links others), the Flare build resolves it into one navigation. For Docusaurus, we will similarly produce one unified sidebar. If multiple distinct TOCs were used for different targets, you would generate a separate sidebar for each Docusaurus site or use Docusaurus’s support for multiple sidebars (if you are combining them into one site for different sections). But typically, one site = one TOC.

In short, **the Flare project’s single-sourcing constructs (conditions, variables, snippets)** must be *resolved* according to a chosen configuration when migrating to a static site. The Flare TOC gives us the structure which we’ll map to Docusaurus sidebars, ensuring the navigation and hierarchy remain intact.

## Conversion Strategy: From Flare to Docusaurus Markdown

Converting a Flare project to Docusaurus involves **extracting the content and structure** from Flare’s XML files and transforming them into Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and a corresponding sidebar configuration. This process can be complex due to the Flare-specific constructs. Here we outline a recommended approach and best practices for a reliable converter:

### 1. Choose the Output Profile (Target)

First, determine which Flare *target* (output) you are converting. All filtering of content (conditions) and variable values should align with that target’s settings. As a best practice, **export one Flare target at a time** to a Docusaurus site. For example, if Flare has separate targets for “User Guide HTML5” and “Admin Guide HTML5”, you would convert each separately (perhaps into different sections or versions of a Docusaurus site). By selecting a target, you know which TOC to use, which conditions to apply, and which variable definitions to pick.

> **Why specify a target?** As a Flare expert on the forums explains, *“the trouble with a general 'export to Markdown' tool is not just HTML-to-Markdown conversion – you must resolve all the MadCap-specific components first. You’d have to specify a target so you can look up variable settings and condition settings, and then process the topic (convert xrefs, expand snippets, etc.)”*. In other words, Flare’s content is context-dependent; a converter needs the target context to know what the final content should look like.

### 2. Extract the TOC Structure

Parse the Flare TOC (`.fltoc`) file for the chosen target (as set in the target’s “Master TOC” setting). This XML gives the hierarchical list of topics in the desired order. Build an in-memory representation of the TOC tree: each entry has a title, a link (which is a path to a topic or sub-TOC), and possibly children entries.

For conversion to Docusaurus:

* Create a **sidebar configuration** that mirrors this structure. In Docusaurus v2, this is typically a JS object exported from `sidebars.js`. For example, you might create an object like:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    mySidebar: [
      {
        type: 'category',
        label: 'User Guide',
        items: [
          'guide/intro',       // corresponds to Intro.md
          {
            type: 'category',
            label: 'Installation',
            items: [
              'guide/install/requirements',
              'guide/install/windows',
              'guide/install/linux',
            ],
          },
          'guide/FAQ'
        ]
      }
    ]
  };
  ```

  This is a conceptual example; the actual structure and item IDs will depend on your file paths and TOC. The `'label'` comes from `TocEntry@Title` and each item corresponds to a Markdown document. If a Flare TOC entry was just a container (no Link), we represent it as a Docusaurus category (non-linking group). If it was a linking entry (points to a topic), we ensure there’s a corresponding MD file and reference it.

* **Filename and ID mapping:** Decide on a mapping from Flare topic files to Markdown file paths. Often you can retain the same filenames (e.g., `Intro.htm` → `Intro.md`) and folder structure. Docusaurus will use the file’s path (or an explicit *id* in frontmatter) to identify the doc. It’s wise to use lowercase, hyphenated filenames for URLs, but Docusaurus can handle mixed-case if needed. Consider replacing spaces or special chars if any in filenames. The goal is that internal links and sidebar references remain consistent. You might choose to drop the `.htm` extension in naming (e.g., a file `Intro.htm` becomes `intro.md` in the `guide/` folder, and you’d reference it as `guide/intro` in the sidebar config).

* **Nested TOCs:** If the Flare TOC had an entry that linked to another TOC (common when large projects are merged), by reading that sub-TOC file you can inline its entries as children in the main structure. Flare may also have *browse sequences* (an alternate linear navigation) but Docusaurus primarily uses the hierarchical sidebar and previous/next navigation based on that – browse sequences can be ignored or handled by ensuring a logical order of docs (Docusaurus will by default generate prev/next from the sidebar order).

### 3. Convert Topic Files to Markdown

This is the core of content conversion. For each topic that will be included (all topics referenced in the TOC, plus any additional topics that are cross-referenced), perform the following:

* **Open and parse the `.htm` topic XML.** Using an XML parser (to handle well-formed XHTML and namespaces properly) is strongly recommended over regex or text matching. This allows you to locate elements like `<MadCap:snippetBlock>`, `<MadCap:conditionalText>`, `<MadCap:xref>`, etc., systematically.

* **Apply condition filtering:** Traverse the XML and remove any elements (or element content) that should be excluded per the target’s conditions. For example, if an element `<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Internal">Secret</MadCap:conditionalText>` has a condition “Internal” that is not included in the chosen target, you would drop that element entirely (nothing of “Secret” goes into the output). If an element has multiple conditions in its attribute, include it only if *all* required conditions for this output are met (Flare’s condition logic is additive by default, but there are advanced cases with multiple condition sets – typically, treat it as a content that is included if any one of its conditions is included by target, unless the Flare project was using an “AND” convention via combined tags). Also remove the `MadCap:conditionalText` wrapper tags themselves for any content that *is* included (the content inside just becomes normal text).

* **Resolve snippets:** Whenever you encounter a snippet reference (`<MadCap:snippetBlock>` or `<MadCap:snippetText>`), open the referenced `.flsnp` file. Recursively process that snippet file’s content through the same filtering and conversion steps (snippets can contain variables, conditions, even other snippets). Once processed, inline the snippet’s content in the place of the reference. Essentially, you *merge* the snippet. This may involve merging XML structures; ensure that block-level snippets end up as proper block elements in Markdown. For example, if a snippet contains a list of steps as `<ol><li>Step1</li><li>Step2</li></ol>` and it’s inserted as a block, make sure in Markdown you get a proper ordered list at that location. If inserted as inline (snippetText), ensure it flows within the sentence properly (e.g., if it was a snippet for a product name, it should just become the text of that name).

* **Replace variables:** Look for occurrences of variables. Depending on how Flare marks them, they might appear as an empty element `<MadCap:variable name="ProductName"/>` or some placeholder text. In an XML parse, you might identify them via a known pattern or by cross-referencing the text with known variable definitions. The easier method is to perform a **post-XML-pass text substitution**: after removing tags for conditions and snippets, you can take the intermediate HTML and do replacements for each variable name with its value. Since you have the list of variables from the `.flvar` file (and any target-specific overrides), you can reliably substitute. For example, replace all occurrences of `MadCap:variable name="Year"` with `2025` (assuming Year=2025). Be careful to avoid replacing unintended text – ideally match the exact XML pattern or surrounding markers of the variables. After replacement, the content should have no Flare variables left, just static text.

* **Convert cross-references and links:** For any `<MadCap:xref>` element, convert it to a standard Markdown link. This means:

  * Determine the target of the xref: usually the `href` attribute (which might be like `"..\Guide\Topic.htm#Bookmark1"` or just `"Topic.htm"`). Make that into a link path that matches the Markdown file of the target. For example, `../Guide/Topic.htm` → `../Guide/Topic.md` (or whatever the target’s new name is). If you are using pretty links (without .md extension in links), adjust accordingly (Docusaurus allows linking by doc ID or by relative path without extension).
  * Determine link text: The content of `<MadCap:xref>` might already contain the resolved text (Flare often stores the last generated text inside the element). In our earlier example, the xref inner text was *“See "Installing" on page 12”*. Since we are making a *single HTML documentation site*, we likely do not want “on page 12”. We might prefer just “See “Installing”” or even just “Installing” as the link text. If the xref uses a format that inserts a page number (which was intended for print PDFs), you should omit that part for the web output. In many cases, if the xref was using the default online format, the inner text might simply be the heading of the target topic. As a converter, you can either trust the given inner text or, for greater accuracy, open the target topic and extract its title (e.g., the text of its first heading) to use as link text. This ensures the link text remains correct even if the Flare cross-reference format was complex or if you want consistency.
  * Finally, output a Markdown link. For example:

    ```markdown
    [See "Installing"](./installing.md)
    ```

    (The exact path depends on where the file resides in the new docs structure.)

  Normal hyperlinks in Flare topics (`<a href="http://...">` or `<a href="../otherTopic.htm">`) that were not managed as xrefs can be converted similarly. External links (starting with http\:// or https\://) can remain the same in Markdown (just use the absolute URL). Internal links to other topics or to anchors need updating to the Markdown file and possibly adjusting the anchor format. For in-page anchors: Flare’s topics might have named anchors or use IDs on headings. Docusaurus can link to headings via `#` and a slug (which is usually the heading text lowercased and hyphenated). You may want to ensure any named anchor links are converted to the appropriate MD link (which might be like `Page.md#section`). Preserve or map any anchor names: if a Flare link references `Topic.htm#AnchorName`, in the Markdown you should ensure the target MD has a corresponding anchor (perhaps by inserting `<a name="AnchorName"></a>` in the MD or by relying on a heading with that ID). This can be an advanced step – often, anchor links aren’t too common except for cross-reference to specific headings or using Flare’s *concept link* feature, which we can handle similarly.

* **Retain formatting and structure:** The content inside the topic’s body, after snippet and condition resolution, is essentially XHTML markup for the documentation content. Now the task is to convert that HTML to Markdown syntax where possible:

  * Headings `<h1>…<h6>` → `# … ######` in Markdown. It’s typical that Flare topics might use `<h1>` for the topic title in each file (or sometimes Flare doesn’t include an `<h1>` in the topic body and instead expects you to use the TOC entry as the title). If the topic’s first heading is missing or you want to enforce one, you could use the TOC Title or the topic file name to generate a top-level `# Title` in Markdown. However, if the Flare topic already has an `<h1>` title in content, keep that. Consider the hierarchy: if all topics have an H1 as title, in Docusaurus each MD file’s content would start with that H1 (which by default may be displayed along with the page). Alternatively, you might use the YAML frontmatter `title:` attribute to set the page title (which Docusaurus will display as an H1 automatically) and **downgrade the actual content headings by one level** (so that you don’t have two titles). This is a stylistic choice. Many conversions choose to put the topic title in the frontmatter and remove the explicit first heading from content to avoid duplication of page title.
  * Paragraphs `<p>` → just plain text separated by blank line in Markdown.
  * Lists `<ul><li>` and `<ol><li>` → `- ` bullet points or `1.` numbered points. Nested lists should maintain their indent levels (Markdown uses 2 or 4 spaces indent for each nesting).
  * Tables: You can use Markdown tables if the tables are simple enough (only plain text in cells). However, Flare tables often have complex formatting (colspans, rowspans, or nested elements). Markdown’s table syntax is limited. A pragmatic approach is to leave tables in HTML (which MDX will accept). Alternatively, if tables are simple and you want to convert, do so carefully. It might be safer to output tables as HTML `<table>` in the Markdown – Docusaurus will render it fine.
  * Images `<img src="...">` → Markdown image syntax `![alt text](path)` if possible. But if there are custom classes or attributes (width, etc.), you may leave the HTML image tag as is. Docusaurus MDX allows raw HTML, which will pass through.
  * Admonitions: If your Flare content has callouts like Note, Tip, Warning, often these are implemented via snippets (e.g., a “Note” snippet that inserts a styled note box with an icon). After conversion, you’ll have something like a blockquote or a div with a class. You might leverage Docusaurus admonitions syntax for a cleaner result. For example, convert a note like:

    ```html
    <div class="Note"><p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to save your work.</p></div>
    ```

    into

    ```markdown
    :::note
    Remember to save your work.
    :::
    ```

    This requires recognizing certain patterns (maybe by class name or snippet name). It’s a nice-to-have improvement. At minimum, ensure such content isn’t lost: you can carry over the HTML or convert it to a blockquote (prepend `> ` to each line) to visually distinguish it.
  * Remove any Flare-only artifacts: For instance, Flare might insert an HTML comment like `<!-- MadCap begIndCond: ... -->` around conditional content, or include meta tags for search score, etc. Those should be stripped out. Also remove elements that won’t be used, like `<script src="MadCapAll.js">` or analytics scripts that Flare output might include in each topic – those won’t be needed in Docusaurus.

After this step, each topic should be converted into clean Markdown (with maybe some inline HTML for complex elements).

* **Add YAML frontmatter:** At the top of each Markdown file, include a YAML block with any metadata needed. The most common is `title: "..."` to define the page title (if you want Docusaurus to use it). You might set the title to the same as the Flare topic’s title or the TOC entry title. This ensures the sidebar label or the browser title will show the proper name. If you want custom sidebar labeling or to group in categories manually, you could also assign a `sidebar_label`, but since we are generating sidebars config, we might not need that (the sidebar config can specify the label separately). Other frontmatter could include `slug` if you want to control URL (by default Docusaurus slug is based on file path). For example, if you want `Intro.md` to have URL `/` (home page of docs), you could slug it accordingly or handle that in routing.

* **Filenames and linking:** Ensure that when you write the Markdown files to disk, their file paths correspond to how you referenced them in the sidebar and cross-links. For example, if `TopicA` in Flare linked to `TopicB.htm` via a cross-ref, and you converted `TopicB.htm` to `TopicB.md` in the same folder, then in `TopicA.md` you might have `[...](TopicB.md)`. Docusaurus will transform that into a correct link (during build it might become `TopicB` or `TopicB.html`). Alternatively, Docusaurus supports linking by document ID (which is basically derived from file path relative to docs/). For simplicity, using relative paths in links that mirror your folder layout is effective. Just remember to adjust “.htm” to “.md” in links while converting.

**Important:** Maintain proper linking and avoid broken references. A systematic approach is to keep a map of old Flare file paths to new MD file paths, and use that to rewrite links. Flare’s TOC and cross-ref usage ensures you know which topics connect to which. You may also scan for any plaintext references to “.htm” in content (like if someone hard-coded a hyperlink) and update them.

### 4. Bring Over Assets (Images, Downloads)

Docusaurus by default has a `/static` directory for static assets (which get copied to the build untouched). If you put an image in `static/img/diagram.png`, you can reference it in Markdown as `/img/diagram.png`. Alternatively, Docusaurus allows images to reside alongside the Markdown files (relative links will be transformed). Either approach works; the latter keeps images near content, the former centralizes them.

**Best practice:** Maintain the directory structure for media if possible. For instance, if Flare had `Content/Resources/Images/`, you could create a corresponding `docs/Resources/Images/` and have the MD refer relatively. Or copy all images to `static/img/` and update references accordingly (maybe even flatten if you prefer). The key is to ensure every `<img>` or media file referenced in the MD has a corresponding file in the new project.

Also, transfer any downloadable files (PDFs, etc.) that were linked in Flare, to the static folder and adjust links.

### 5. Verify and Enhance

After conversion, you will have a set of Markdown files and a sidebar definition. At this stage:

* **Build the Docusaurus site** and check that the sidebar appears as expected (same hierarchy as Flare TOC), all pages are present, and navigation (prev/next) goes in the right order (Docusaurus will default to TOC order).

* **Check links:** Click through cross-page links and image links to ensure none are broken. If any links were missed (e.g., a link in Flare that wasn’t in the TOC and you didn’t convert that topic), convert those topics too or adjust the link to an external reference if you chose not to bring that content.

* **Search:** Docusaurus will index the content of your Markdown for search. You might not need to do anything special, but if some important metadata (like Flare index keywords or search synonyms) were present, you could consider adding them as hidden text or using frontmatter tags (Docusaurus can use frontmatter like `tags: ["]` for categories, though not exactly the same as Flare index keywords).

* **Styling adjustments:** If certain styles didn’t carry over (for example, maybe text that was colored or formatted via a class in Flare), you have a couple options:

  * Add custom CSS in Docusaurus (in `src/css/custom.css`) to target those elements or classes. For example, if some paragraphs had a class `.Important` that gave a red highlight in Flare, you can carry that class into the HTML (it would appear in the MD as `<p class="Important">...</p>`) and then define `.markdown .Important { ... }` in Docusaurus CSS.
  * Alternatively, convert those to standard Docusaurus admonitions or other Markdown constructs as mentioned earlier.

* **Table of Contents on pages:** Docusaurus can automatically generate an in-page table of contents for headings (usually displayed on the right side). Flare also had a proxy for mini-TOCs (like a “On this page” for headings) or maybe used *h1 vs h2* to delineate topics vs subtopics. In Markdown, just using appropriate heading levels will let Docusaurus create that mini-TOC. No extra work needed aside from ensuring the hierarchy of headings is logical.

* **Pagination:** If the Flare browse sequence or default previous/next reading order is important, Docusaurus by default will consider the sidebar order as the doc ordering. That should suffice (the sidebar order is our TOC order). If you need a custom ordering separate from sidebar, Docusaurus allows overriding next/prev manually in frontmatter, but likely not needed.

### 6. Testing and Iteration

It’s likely you will iterate on the converter script or process. Here are **best practices** and tips learned from such migrations:

* **Automate with scripting or XSLT:** Given the repetitive nature (potentially hundreds of topics), writing a script (in Python, Node, etc.) to do the XML parse and conversion is ideal. Many have used XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language) to transform Flare XML to other formats since Flare’s XML is consistent. For example, you could write an XSLT to apply to each topic: it could remove MadCap namespaces, process snippets by extension functions, etc. Using an XML-aware tool ensures you handle things like entity references (Flare might use `&nbsp;` or others) properly and output well-formed Markdown (which is basically text). A combination of XSLT for structural transformation and some post-processing in a script can be effective.

* **Leverage existing tools cautiously:** There are some existing converters (e.g., a **MadCap Flare to Markdown** plugin by a third party, or open-source scripts like *flare-to-markdown* on GitHub). These can provide inspiration, but you must still verify that all nuances (conditions, cross-refs) are handled. If using them, ensure they allow specifying a target or otherwise incorporate conditions/variables (the plugin mentioned does convert all topics and snippets, but you'd still need to handle conditional exclusion manually by perhaps preparing a Flare target that excludes unwanted content and maybe using the *“exclude content not linked”* option to drop orphaned topics).

* **Preserve source control history (optional):** If maintaining the project history is important and you have the Flare project in source control, you might consider doing the conversion in a way that maps Flare files to Markdown files one-to-one so you could potentially trace back. In practice, this is rarely needed – treat it as a new project initialization in Docusaurus, with the Flare project as reference.

* **Documentation and team training:** Once converted, update your team’s workflow documentation. Authors used to Flare need to know how to update content in Markdown/MDX now. Some aspects (like adding a new page) require adding to sidebars.js, whereas in Flare one would add to a TOC – conceptually similar but done in code. Variables in Flare might be replaced by simple search/replace or templates in MD (or using partial includes), so establish how things like product name updates will be done (perhaps a global search, or use Docusaurus environment variables if needed for things like version numbers).

* **Quality check the content:** Read through some pages in the Docusaurus site and compare with the Flare output or source to ensure nothing significant was lost or altered. Pay attention to lists, special characters, code blocks, and tables – these often have formatting issues if conversion isn’t thorough.

By following these steps, you create a **maintainable Markdown-based documentation** that retains the structure and content of the original Flare project. The heavy lifting lies in converting the rich Flare XML (with single-sourcing features) into a simpler, static format. Once done, the documentation can be served via Docusaurus with all the benefits of a static site (fast loading, easy theming, versioning, etc.).

### Summary of Key Recommendations

* **Plan per target** – Extract content using one Flare target’s settings at a time to ensure correct inclusion/exclusion of content and proper variable values.
* **Use XML parsing** – Flare files are XML; leverage that to accurately identify and transform elements (topics, snippets, conditions, xrefs) rather than treating files as plain text. This avoids errors with nested tags or special characters.
* **Merge and replace** – Merge snippets in place and replace variables with their current values so that the Markdown output is self-contained with no dependencies on Flare-specific features.
* **Preserve structure** – Keep the topic hierarchy from the TOC. The user experience in Docusaurus should mirror the Flare help system’s organization. This includes sequence (for next/prev navigation) and grouping (sections).
* **Maintain links** – Ensure all cross-references and hyperlinks become functional links in the static site. Do not hard-code “.htm” extensions; use relative paths or Docusaurus doc IDs that will be resolved. It’s easy to accidentally break links during conversion, so use automated link mapping and consider validating links post-build.
* **Don’t skip the assets** – Copy over all images and media. A missing image in the docs can confuse users; if the Flare output had it, so should the Docusaurus site. Adjust paths in the Markdown or static folder so images load correctly.
* **Test frequently** – As you develop the conversion process, run the Docusaurus site locally to catch formatting issues early. It’s easier to tweak the conversion (e.g., how code snippets or notes are handled) when you can see the outcome immediately.
* **Leverage Docusaurus features** – Take advantage of Markdown enhancements like code blocks (for any sample code from Flare) or admonitions (for notes/warnings) to make the documentation look polished. Docusaurus also supports multi-language content and versioning; if your Flare project had those concepts (maybe via condition tags for version or language), you might integrate with Docusaurus’s approach (e.g., use Docusaurus Versioning for different releases rather than conditions).
* **Document the mapping** – It’s useful to document how each Flare construct was mapped. For example: *Condition “Internal” – excluded from public docs*, *Snippet “NoteBox” – converted to :::note admonition*, *Variable ProductName – replaced with “AcmePro”*, etc. This will help future maintainers understand the decisions made during conversion.

By meticulously converting the **complete taxonomy** of Flare project elements into Markdown, YAML, and other static site constructs, you set up a Docusaurus documentation site that should closely resemble the original Flare output in content and organization. The end result is that all **topics** become individual Markdown files, the Flare **TOC** becomes the Docusaurus sidebar, **snippets** and **variables** are resolved into the text, **conditions** are applied to include the right content, and **links/media** function properly in the new site. This thorough approach ensures nothing is lost in translation and the single-sourced content integrity is maintained in the new platform.

# Converting MadCap Flare Documentation to Docusaurus: Technical Guide

## Introduction

Migrating from MadCap Flare (a powerful XML-based authoring tool) to Docusaurus (a modern React-based static site generator) involves converting Flare’s structured content into Markdown and organizing it for Docusaurus. This report provides a comprehensive guide for developers building an open-source conversion tool. It covers an overview of Markdown syntax (focusing on GitHub Flavored Markdown), Docusaurus project structure and conventions, required metadata and frontmatter, handling of static assets, the Docusaurus plugin ecosystem, validation tools for converted content, useful conversion libraries (especially in Python), and best practices with common challenges in such a migration.

## 1. Markdown Syntax Overview (GFM and Docusaurus Extensions)

**CommonMark vs. GFM:** Markdown is a lightweight markup format with a readable plaintext syntax. *CommonMark* is the standardized core of Markdown, and **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** is a strict superset of CommonMark. GFM adds useful extensions like tables, task lists, and strikethrough, which are widely used on GitHub and supported by many tools. Docusaurus uses the MDX parser with CommonMark and GFM support (via Remark plugins) as the basis for documentation content.

**Basic Markdown Elements:** In Markdown, you use simple punctuation for formatting:

* **Headings:** Prefix lines with `#` for headings. `#` is an H1, `##` an H2, and so on up to ###### for H6. For example, `## Installation` will render as a second-level heading.
* **Paragraphs:** Just write text in a new line for a paragraph. Blank lines separate paragraphs.
* **Emphasis:** Use `*` or `_` around text for *italic* and double `**` or `__` for **bold**. GFM also supports `~~strike-through~~` for ~~strikethrough~~ text.
* **Lists:** Use `- ` or `* ` for bullet lists, and `1.` `2.` for numbered lists. Nesting is done by indenting 2 or 4 spaces. GFM also supports **task list** items using `[ ]` or `[x]` in list items (rendering checkboxes: `[x] Done`, `[ ] Todo`).
* **Code:** Inline code is wrapped in backticks, e.g. `` `code` ``. Blocks of code are fenced by triple backticks `or indented 4 spaces. Fenced code blocks can optionally specify a language for syntax highlighting (e.g.`js for JavaScript).
* **Links and Images:** A link uses `[link text](URL)` and an image uses `![alt text](URL)`. For example: `This is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io)` or `![Logo](/img/logo.png)`. If you put a bare URL in text, GFM’s autolink extension will often hyperlink it automatically.
* **Blockquotes:** Prefix a line with `>` to create a quote block. This can be nested (`>>`) or span multiple paragraphs if each line starts with `>`.

**Tables (GFM Extension):** GFM adds multi-column table syntax. Use pipes to separate columns and hyphens to separate header row from body. For example:

```markdown
| Feature       | Description                |
|-------------- |----------------------------|
| **Markdown**  | Plain text formatting      |
| **Docusaurus**| Static site generator tool |
```

This would render a table with two columns, and you can align text by adding colons in the separator (e.g. `:---` for left-align, `---:` right-align, `:---:` center). Tables are not in pure CommonMark but are supported by GFM.

**GitHub Flavored Extras:** In addition to tables and task lists, GFM supports automatic linking of URLs and emails, and an extension for ***footnotes*** (a newer addition). Footnotes use the syntax `[^1]` in text and a definition like `[^1]: Footnote text.` at the bottom. Docusaurus (via Remark GFM) supports these as well. All GFM extensions are optional additions to base Markdown but widely adopted.

**Markdown in Docusaurus (MDX):** Docusaurus v2/v3 uses **MDX**, which extends Markdown by allowing JSX/React components inline. Practically, you can use all standard Markdown (with GFM features), and also include HTML or React components if needed:

* **Admonitions (Notes/Warnings):** Docusaurus has a custom Markdown extension for call-out boxes. Using a **triple-colon syntax**, you can create an admonition. For example:

  ```markdown
  :::note  
  **Note:** This is an important note.  
  :::  
  ```

  This will render a styled note box with a default title "Note". Supported types are `note`, `tip`, `info`, `caution`, `danger`, etc., each with appropriate icon and coloring (these are provided by the `remark-admonitions` plugin). You can optionally add a custom title after the type (e.g. `:::tip My Tip`).
* **MDX Components:** Because MDX allows JSX, you can import and use React components. For example, you could embed an interactive component or custom UI by writing JSX directly in the `.mdx` file. Docusaurus documentation itself uses this for things like tabs and live code editors. *Best practice:* Use MDX for special cases (interactive diagrams, API components), but keep the majority of content in pure Markdown for simplicity and easier conversion.
* **Custom Containers and HTML:** Standard HTML tags can be included in MDX if needed (e.g. `<details>`/`<summary>` for collapsible sections). Docusaurus’s MDX is configured to safely allow some HTML (`rehype-raw` enabled), so if certain Flare content doesn’t translate to Markdown, you can embed it as raw HTML. However, avoid excessive raw HTML as it can hinder readability and maintainability.

**Summary of Markdown Syntax (GFM) vs Docusaurus Additions:** The table below summarizes key syntax elements:

| Syntax (Markdown/GFM)                        | Description / Example                                                                                    |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ---- | -- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `# Heading 1`<br>`## Heading 2`              | ATX headings (H1, H2, etc.) in Markdown.                                                                 |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `**bold**` & `*italic*`                      | Bold and italic text. GFM also allows `~~strike~~` for strikethrough.                                    |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `- Item` or `1. Item`                        | Unordered (`-`/`*`) and ordered lists (`1.` `2.`).                                                       |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `- [x] Done`<br>`- [ ] Todo`                 | Task list items with checkboxes (GFM extension).                                                         |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `` ```js` <br>`console.log("hi");`<br>``` `` | Fenced code block with language (JavaScript example).                                                    |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `> Quote text`                               | Blockquote for quoting text blocks.                                                                      |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| \`                                           | Col A                                                                                                    | Col B | `<br>` | ------ | ------ | `<br>` | Val1 | Val2 | \` | Table with header and rows (GFM extension). |
| `[Link](https://example.com)`                | Hyperlink to external or internal URL (omit “.md” extension for doc links).                              |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `![Alt](./image.png)`                        | Image embed. In Docusaurus, absolute paths (`/img/...`) or relative paths are resolved as static assets. |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `:::note ... :::`                            | Docusaurus admonition for call-outs (note, tip, warning, etc.).                                          |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |
| `<MyComponent prop="x" />`                   | MDX: Embed a React component or HTML directly in the content.                                            |       |        |        |        |        |      |      |    |                                             |

Docusaurus’s use of MDX means **all GFM syntax** (tables, task lists, etc.) is supported out-of-the-box. The admonition syntax and MDX components are Docusaurus-specific extensions to Markdown, letting you create richer docs beyond plain text. When converting Flare content, aim to represent it with standard Markdown where possible, and use these Docusaurus/MDX features to handle special formatting (like notes, warnings, tabs) that Markdown alone can’t express.

## 2. Docusaurus Structure and Conventions

A Docusaurus documentation site has a particular structure and set of conventions. Understanding these is crucial when mapping Flare content to Docusaurus. The main pieces include the file organization (docs folder, static assets, config files), how sidebars and navigation are defined, how versioning works, and how pages are configured via frontmatter metadata.

### Project File Organization

A typical Docusaurus project (using the classic preset) has the following layout:

```
my-project/
├── docusaurus.config.js        # Site configuration (title, theme, plugins, etc.)
├── sidebars.js (or sidebars.ts)# Sidebar definitions for docs (optional if autogen)
├── docs/                       # Markdown documentation content
│   ├── intro.md
│   ├── guide/                  # Sub-folders group docs by category
│   │   ├── part1.md
│   │   └── part2.md
│   └── tutorials/
│       ├── tutorial1.md
│       └── tutorial2.md
├── static/                     # Static assets (images, PDFs, etc.)
│   └── img/
│       └── logo.png
├── src/
│   └── pages/                  # Custom pages (optional)
│       └── index.js            # Home page if not using docs-only mode
└── package.json (and other build files)
```

In Docusaurus, all files in the `docs/` directory are treated as documentation pages. By default, each Markdown file in `docs` becomes a page under the `/docs/` URL section of the site. This is analogous to Flare topics or HTML files. Organizing docs into subfolders (e.g., `guide/`, `tutorials/`) will by default create corresponding sections in the site’s URL and (if using autogenerated sidebar) in the navigation hierarchy.

**Special Filenames:** If a Markdown file is named `README.md` or `index.md` and is in a folder, Docusaurus treats it as the index of that folder, and by default the URL will use the folder path without the filename. For example, `docs/Guides/README.md` or `docs/Guides/Guides.md` would serve as the “Guides” section landing page at `/docs/Guides` rather than `/docs/Guides/Guides`. This is useful for creating section landing pages (similar to Flare’s concept of book or chapter TOC pages).

**Ignoring Files:** Any file prefixed with an underscore (`_`) in the docs folder is ignored by Docusaurus. This convention is often used for *partials* or include files (like reusable snippets in Markdown, not directly a page). When converting Flare, you might leverage this by outputting snippet content as separate files (prefixed with `_`) if you plan to include them into other docs via MDX import, ensuring they don’t become standalone pages.

**Document IDs and URLs:** Every doc has an *ID* and a *URL*:

* By default, the **document ID** is derived from its path relative to `docs/` (excluding extension). For example, `docs/greeting.md` has ID “greeting”, and `docs/guide/hello.md` has ID “guide/hello”. These IDs are used for linking and for the sidebar configuration.
* The **URL** (slug) by default is also based on the file path. A file `docs/guide/hello.md` becomes accessible at `/docs/guide/hello` (assuming base URL `/docs/`). If a file is named `index.md` in a folder, the URL ends at the folder name (as noted above). You can override URLs with frontmatter if needed (see **Slug** in metadata section below).

**Docs-Only Mode:** Docusaurus can run in “docs-only” mode where the site’s main homepage is one of the docs. If you prefer to have the documentation at the root of the site (instead of under `/docs`), you can adjust the routing in `docusaurus.config.js` (the classic preset allows setting `routeBasePath: '/'` for docs). In a migration context, if you want the new site to mirror the old documentation site’s structure exactly, you might consider docs-only mode so that, for example, `/Introduction` is directly a doc page. Otherwise, keep the default which prefixes all doc URLs with `/docs/` (useful if you also have a landing page or blog).

### Sidebar and Navigation (sidebars.js)

Docusaurus uses *sidebars* to organize docs into a navigation menu (usually displayed on the left for docs pages). The sidebar defines the hierarchy and labeling of docs in the table of contents. There are two main approaches to sidebars:

* **Manually defined sidebars** in the `sidebars.js` (or `.ts`) file.
* **Autogenerated sidebars** based on the file system structure.

**Manual Sidebar Configuration:** In `sidebars.js`, you define an exported JavaScript object (or array) that Docusaurus reads. For example:

```js
// sidebars.js
module.exports = {
  docs: [
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Guide',
      items: [
        'intro',             // refers to docs/intro.md by ID
        'guide/part1',       // docs/guide/part1.md
        'guide/part2',       // docs/guide/part2.md
      ],
    },
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorials',
      items: ['tutorials/tutorial1', 'tutorials/tutorial2'],
    },
    { 
      type: 'link', 
      label: 'Project API', 
      href: 'https://example.com/api' 
    }
  ],
};
```

This defines a sidebar with two categories (“Guide” and “Tutorials”) and an external link. Each doc is referenced by its ID (which by default is its file path without extension). A `category` can contain nested items (docs or further sub-categories). A `link` can point to an external URL or another internal route. Manual sidebars give you full control over ordering and grouping. In the above, `'intro'` corresponds to `docs/intro.md`, and `'guide/part1'` corresponds to `docs/guide/part1.md` (because its ID would be “guide/part1”). If you manually define a sidebar like this, any docs not included in it will not appear in the sidebar navigation.

**Autogenerated Sidebar:** Docusaurus can generate a sidebar slice automatically from the folder structure. In `sidebars.js`, this is done by specifying an item of type `'autogenerated'` with a `dirName`. For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  docs: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.' }]  // generate sidebar from docs/structure
};
```

This will make Docusaurus traverse the `docs` directory and create categories for subfolders and links for each doc, using file names and frontmatter to determine order and titles. Autogenerated sidebars are convenient for large imports because you don’t have to manually list every file. **Ordering:** By default, autogenerated items are ordered alphabetically by file name. To control order, you can prepend numbers to filenames or use the `sidebar_position` metadata in each doc. For instance, in frontmatter you might put `sidebar_position: 2` to position a doc within its folder category. You can also add a `_category_.json` file in a folder to define the category’s label or order as a whole (including using a float like `2.5` for position).

For the Flare conversion tool, you have a choice:

* **Generate sidebars.js** from Flare’s TOC: This allows preserving the *curated* structure that Flare’s Table of Contents had (which might not strictly match folder structure). The tool can read the Flare TOC XML and produce a corresponding sidebar configuration, mapping each Flare topic to the converted Markdown doc path.
* **Use Autogenerated**: You could also organize the exported Markdown files in directories reflecting the TOC hierarchy and let Docusaurus autogenerate. To ensure correct ordering (since Flare’s TOC order might not be alphabetical), the conversion could add numeric prefixes to filenames or add `sidebar_position` in each file’s frontmatter. For example, prefixing files like `01_Introduction.md, 02_GettingStarted.md` etc., or using frontmatter positions as shown in Docusaurus docs.

**Sidebar Tips:** Keep category and doc labels short for navigation clarity. You can override a doc’s label in the sidebar without changing its title by using the `sidebar_label` frontmatter (or by explicitly naming it in sidebars.js). For complex documentation, nested categories can mirror Flare’s book/chapters. Also, note that sidebars can be split – you can have multiple sidebars (e.g., for different documentation sets) and assign docs to them accordingly, but for most migrations a single unified sidebar is simpler.

### Versioning Structure

If your Flare documentation was versioned (e.g., separate outputs for v1, v2 of a product), Docusaurus’s **versioning** feature can be used. Versioning in Docusaurus allows multiple sets of docs (e.g., “latest” and older versions) to coexist. Key points:

* You generate a version by running `docusaurus docs:version <versionName>`. This copies the current `docs/` content into a new directory under `versioned_docs/` and freezes it.
* The project will create a `versions.json` file and a `versioned_sidebars/` file for that version’s sidebar. For example, after versioning, you might have:

  * `docs/` (continues to be the working set for “next” or unreleased docs).
  * `versioned_docs/version-1.0/` (snapshot of docs at v1.0).
  * `versioned_docs/version-2.0/` (snapshot for v2.0, etc.).
  * `versioned_sidebars/version-1.0-sidebars.json` for the sidebar of that version.
* Docusaurus URLs for versions: By default, the “latest” version (e.g., 1.0 if that’s the newest) will still use `/docs/` base, and older versions get prefixed (e.g., `/docs/1.0/...`). You can configure which version is treated as the main/default.

If you plan to migrate multiple Flare outputs (like separate projects or versions), you could import one as the initial docs, then run the versioning command, then import the next, etc., or manually place content into the versioned_docs structure. **Alternatively**, if Flare used conditional text for versions rather than separate projects, you might split those by running the conversion for each version of the content and leveraging Docusaurus versions to host them side by side.

**Versioning Considerations:** It’s often easiest to perform the conversion for the latest documentation first (into `docs/`), get everything working, then use Docusaurus to create a version snapshot and then replace the `docs/` with the next version’s content. The sidebar can often be similar between versions, but if not, you can generate separate sidebars for each. Docusaurus’s versioning yields a structure like `docs/` (current) + `versioned_docs/` (past versions), with Docusaurus knowing to route appropriately. If you don’t need versioned docs, simply ignore this feature and keep one set of Markdown files.

### Metadata Frontmatter in Markdown Files

Every Markdown/MDX file in Docusaurus can have a **YAML frontmatter** block at the top (between `---` lines). This frontmatter provides metadata that Docusaurus uses for routing, labeling, and behavior of the doc. While frontmatter is optional (Docusaurus can infer some things), it is highly recommended to include certain fields for a migrated doc set. Important frontmatter fields include:

* **id:** Manually sets the document’s unique ID (overriding the default path-derived ID). Use this if you want an ID different from the filename or need to ensure consistency regardless of file location. For example, `id: getting-started` in `intro.md` will make its ID “getting-started” instead of “intro”. *If you use a custom `id`, note that it also influences the default URL (slug) in Docusaurus v2+*.
* **title:** The title of the document. This is used as the H1 heading shown on the page (unless you hide the title) and in the page’s `<title>` for SEO. If no frontmatter title is given, Docusaurus will use the first markdown heading in the content as the title. We suggest setting `title` explicitly for clarity (especially if you plan to hide the autogenerated heading).
* **slug:** Allows you to set a custom URL path for the document. By default, a doc’s URL is derived from its file path. If you want to, say, flatten the URL or change it, you can use `slug`. Example: in `guide/intro.md`, `slug: /introduction` would make the page accessible at `/docs/introduction` instead of `/docs/guide/intro`. Use this sparingly for special cases (like making a doc the home of docs section).
* **sidebar_label:** If you are using an autogenerated sidebar, this label will be used for the doc in the sidebar instead of the title. This is useful if your page title is long but you want a shorter label in the nav. For manually written sidebars, you can also just put the desired label in the sidebars.js file itself.
* **sidebar_position:** A numeric position for ordering in an autogenerated sidebar. Docs within the same folder (or category) will be sorted by this (ascending). It can be an integer or float (you might use 1.1, 1.2 for fine control). If not provided, alphabetical by file name is default. In Flare, topics are ordered in the TOC – capturing that order can be done by assigning sidebar_position values in the conversion process.
* **description:** A short description of the page, used in the `<meta>` description for SEO and sometimes in search results preview. This is not visible on the page but good to include (one or two sentences summarizing the topic).
* **tags:** You can assign tags (an array of strings) to docs. This is optional, but Docusaurus can generate tag listing pages if you use this. If Flare had index keywords or categories, you might map those to tags in Markdown.
* **hide_title:** Set to `true` to not display the title on the page. By default, Docusaurus will render the `title` (or the first heading) as an H1 at the top of the content. If your Markdown already includes an H1 that you want to keep (for styling or legacy reasons), you might end up with duplicate titles. Setting `hide_title: true` will prevent the default title from showing, so you can use your own in the content.
* **hide_table_of_contents:** Set to `true` to disable the right-hand table of contents for that page. By default, Docusaurus generates a mini-TOC on the right side listing the headings in the page. If a page is very short or you don’t want that, you can hide it.

An example frontmatter for a doc might look like:

```yaml
---
id: install-guide
title: "Installation Guide"
slug: /install
sidebar_label: "Install"
sidebar_position: 3
description: "How to install and configure the application."
tags: [Setup, Release1.0]
---
```

In the above example, the file might be `docs/setup/install.md` originally, but we set a custom `id` and `slug` so it will appear at URL `/docs/install` and have a specific sidebar label and order. Docusaurus will use these values when generating the site navigation. (If this doc is part of an autogenerated sidebar, it will show with label “Install” in position 3 in its category; if manual, we’d refer to it by `id: install-guide` in sidebars.js.)

**Note:** Frontmatter must be at the very top of the file and bounded by `---` lines. Ensure the YAML is valid (e.g., strings in quotes if they contain special characters). The conversion tool should populate at least `title` (from the Flare topic title) and possibly `id` (maybe using Flare’s topic ID or file name) and any other needed fields like `sidebar_position`. If the conversion output will use an autogenerated sidebar, including `sidebar_position` for each doc according to the Flare TOC order is very helpful; if a manual sidebar is output, then the order is controlled in sidebars.js.

### Custom Components and MDX Integration

One powerful aspect of Docusaurus is that all docs are MDX (Markdown with JSX). This means you can extend content with React components or dynamic content. When converting from Flare:

* **Reusing Content (Snippets):** Flare snippets are reusable chunks. Docusaurus doesn’t have an out-of-the-box snippet mechanism, but you can simulate it with MDX. For example, you could convert a Flare snippet to a Markdown file (perhaps in a `_includes` or `_shared` folder, prefixed with `_` so it’s ignored as a standalone page). Then in any MDX doc, you can import it and use it as a component. E.g., in `myDoc.mdx`:

  ```jsx
  import SnippetContent from '@site/docs/_shared/mySnippet.md';
  …  
  <SnippetContent />
  ```

  This will include the content of `mySnippet.md` at that point. (Alternatively, convert snippets directly into static content in each topic during conversion to keep things simpler.)
* **Special Formatting:** If Flare topics used styled text boxes for notes, tips, warnings, etc., you can map these to Docusaurus admonitions. For instance, a Flare “Note” text box can become `:::note ... :::` in Markdown. The conversion tool might detect certain icons or styles in the HTML and inject the admonition syntax or a custom admonition if needed. Docusaurus’s default admonitions cover many common callouts (Note, Tip, Info, Caution, Danger).
* **Conditional Content:** Flare conditions allow including/excluding content per target. Docusaurus has no direct equivalent of conditional text in Markdown. If some content was conditional in Flare and you need to carry that logic over, you have a few options:

  * Generate separate versions or separate docs for each condition state (for example, if a section was Windows vs Linux content, you could split into two docs or use tabs).
  * Use MDX to create a custom React component that conditionally renders content based on some site context (this requires writing a plugin or some global state, which is advanced). In most cases, it’s simpler to resolve conditions at conversion time, producing static content for one chosen output or duplicating sections if needed.
* **Interactive or Dynamic Content:** With MDX, you can embed things like API interactive consoles, diagrams (there’s a plugin for Mermaid diagrams, for example), or other React components. Identify if any Flare content (e.g. HTML5 widgets or scripts) need replacement. Docusaurus can embed raw HTML/JS, but often a React reimplementation is cleaner. Plugins exist for things like Mermaid charts, math equations, etc., which might be relevant if Flare used any script for those.
* **Global Variables:** Flare’s variables (e.g., product name variables) would typically be resolved to text during conversion for a static site. Alternatively, Docusaurus could use React context or environment variables, but that complicates the setup. The straightforward approach is to replace Flare variables with their value when generating Markdown. However, if the tool needed to handle multiple product variants, you could output a separate Markdown version for each variant or instruct authors to use a simple placeholder and then do a find-replace in the content build. Generally, since Docusaurus treats content as code, having dynamic variables inside is not typical (aside from versioning and translation which are separate concerns).

In summary, Docusaurus’s MDX allows a lot of flexibility. For an automated conversion, it might be wise to keep the output Markdown as simple as possible (favoring static content) and only use MDX enhancements for things you *cannot represent in plain Markdown*. This reduces the chance of introducing errors and makes the converted content easier to maintain by documentation writers in the future (they can edit Markdown without needing to know React, in most cases).

## 3. Required and Recommended Metadata in Docusaurus Markdown

**Frontmatter Best Practices:** As noted, Docusaurus does not strictly *require* frontmatter in each doc (it will infer title from first heading, id from filename, etc. by default). However, including frontmatter is recommended to ensure consistency. Here are the key metadata fields to include in each Markdown file after conversion:

* **title:** Provide a title for each page. In Flare, the topic title can be used here. This ensures the page has an H1 and is labeled correctly.
* **id (optional):** If you want to control the document ID (especially for linking or if file names are not ideal identifiers), set an `id`. One scenario: if Flare file names are cryptic (e.g., `TOPIC_ABC123.htm`), you might name the Markdown file more nicely (e.g., `getting-started.md`) and set `id: topic-getting-started` or similar. However, you can often skip setting `id` and let Docusaurus derive it from the file name, which will be the simpler approach if the filenames are already meaningful.
* **slug (optional):** Use only if you need to override the URL path. For example, to match an old URL structure or to shorten a deeply nested path. If not set, the default `/docs/` + path is used. Only a subset of pages may need this (like if you want one doc to be the root `/docs/` or you want to flatten one level).
* **sidebar_label:** For autogenerated sidebars, if a page’s title is too long to show in navigation, you can set a shorter `sidebar_label`. For example, a page titled “How to Install the XYZ Product on Windows and Linux” might have a sidebar_label: “Installation”. In manual sidebars, you control labels directly in the config, so this is mainly for autogen convenience.
* **sidebar_position:** If using autogen sidebars, include this for every doc to reflect the TOC order from Flare. If generating a manual sidebar, you can skip this (since order is in sidebars.js). But it doesn’t hurt to include; it just won’t be used in manual scenario.
* **description:** Adding a one-line description frontmatter helps SEO and provides a hover preview if using search plugins. Flare’s topics might have an abstract or short description which you can use here.
* **others:** `tags` if categorizing content, or any Docusaurus-specific flags like `draft: true` (if you want to exclude a page from production builds, e.g., if some topics are not ready – note that `draft` is a relatively new frontmatter option in Docusaurus).

When generating frontmatter via a script, ensure YAML syntax is correct. Also remember that in Docusaurus v2+, specifying an `id` effectively sets the slug to `/{id}` if slug is not separately provided. So if you set `id`, the page URL may change from the file-based path. If preserving path is important, you might actually avoid setting `id` unless necessary (or set both `id` and `slug` to maintain a certain structure).

**Minimal frontmatter vs. explicit:** For a straightforward migration, you might include just:

```yaml
---
title: "Original Topic Title"
---
```

and let everything else be default. Docusaurus will generate an ID from the file name and a URL accordingly, and use the title for display. However, to precisely control ordering and ensure future stability, adding `sidebar_position` and a custom `id` can be good. It’s a balance between effort and need:

* If you want **human-friendly file names** to double as IDs/URLs, you can rely on those and keep frontmatter minimal.
* If you want to decouple **IDs from file names** (maybe to allow renaming files later without breaking links), use the `id` field consistently and use those IDs in any cross-links and sidebars.

**Frontmatter and Warnings:** Docusaurus will warn or error if there are duplicate IDs. So ensure all `id` values are unique across all docs (including across versioned docs). Also, if you accidentally reference an ID in sidebars or links that doesn’t exist, you will get a broken link error on build (more on link checking in a later section). Use a systematic naming scheme for ids if you set them (e.g., prefix with section or use full path as id) to avoid collisions.

In summary, the *required* metadata is essentially just a title (to avoid having to put an H1 in the Markdown manually), but the *recommended* metadata includes sidebar ordering and any custom slugs/IDs needed to preserve structure. By planning the frontmatter fields, your converted docs will integrate smoothly into Docusaurus and behave as expected in navigation.

## 4. Handling Static Assets (Images, PDFs) in Docusaurus

Documentation often includes images, diagrams, PDFs, and other assets. Docusaurus can handle these, but the approach differs from Flare’s storage of resources. Here’s how Docusaurus manages static assets and how to properly link them:

**Static Folder vs. Asset Co-location:** By default, Docusaurus provides a `static/` directory for assets. Any file placed in `static` will be copied directly into the final build output (preserving relative paths). For example, `static/img/picture.png` ends up as `site.com/img/picture.png` in the deployed site. The benefit of `static` is that you can reference files by a simple path and they don’t go through Webpack processing. However, Docusaurus also supports **co-locating assets** in the docs folders and will bundle them:

* If you write a Markdown link or image with an absolute path (starting with `/`), Docusaurus looks in the static folder for that file. E.g. `![Diagram](/img/diagram.svg)` will be resolved to `static/img/diagram.svg` (or `public/img/diagram.svg`) if it exists. During site build, it actually converts that to a webpack require and appends a hash to the filename for cache-busting.
* If you use a relative path in Markdown (e.g. `![Diagram](./images/diagram.svg)` where `images/diagram.svg` is a file alongside the MD file), Docusaurus will treat it similarly by bundling it. In fact, Docusaurus **automatically converts markdown references to images or files into require() calls** so that you can colocate assets with docs. This means you are not forced to dump all images into `static/` if you prefer to keep them next to the content.

**Best Practice:** You have two options for organizing images:

1. **All in static/** – e.g., put all Flare images into `static/img/flare/…` and update image references in Markdown to absolute paths like `/img/flare/imagename.png`. This approach makes it clear where assets live and is straightforward (similar to Flare’s centralized *Content Explorer*). The images in static can be referenced directly and will not be hashed or processed (they are served as-is).
2. **Co-locate with docs** – e.g., for each doc or section, put its images in a subfolder alongside the Markdown. Update image references to relative paths. For example, in `docs/guide/part1.md`, reference an image `![UI](./part1_assets/screen.png)`. Docusaurus will bundle that image, copying it to the build assets and giving it a hashed filename for caching. This keeps images near the content, which can be easier to manage for authors and prevents the `static` folder from becoming a huge dumping ground.

Both approaches are valid. Co-location often results in a tidier project structure for large doc sets (you could mimic Flare’s *Topics and images in same folder* organization, if that was how the Flare project was laid out). The conversion tool can either copy all media from Flare into `static/` or mirror the Flare project folder hierarchy under `docs/` (with images in subfolders). Note that if you co-locate, your Markdown links should be **relative** (Docusaurus will convert them to webpack require calls automatically, ensuring the links work and broken references are caught at build time).

**Linking to Files (PDF, etc.):** The same rules apply. If you have a PDF user guide to link, you can put it in `static/files/Guide.pdf` and then in Markdown do: `[Download Guide](/files/Guide.pdf)`. This will be transformed into a runtime link that goes to the correct location (with base URL accounted for). Behind the scenes, it becomes something like `<a href={require('static/files/Guide.pdf')}>Download Guide</a>` in the React code. If a file is co-located (say `docs/manuals/install.pdf` and you do `[Install PDF](./manuals/install.pdf)` in Markdown), that also gets included via Webpack require (so the PDF will end up hashed in the build output, e.g., `install.abc123.pdf` in `assets/files` and the link will point to that). A benefit of this bundling is that missing files are caught early (if the file isn’t found, the build will error).

**Image Handling Differences:** If images are in `static/`, you refer to them with absolute path and they are not processed (no resizing or optimizing by default, just copied). If you use the MDX built-in image handling (importing or requiring images), you could potentially leverage image optimization plugins (like `@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image` for responsive images). However, initially, simply migrating images over without altering them is fine. Keep in mind:

* Docusaurus will not compress or optimize images by itself (except for the optional IdealImage plugin). So large PNGs from Flare remain large PNGs. Consider optimizing images if size is an issue.
* The `static/` approach will keep file names identical (useful if you want to preserve exact names for some reason). The co-located approach will give hashed names in the final output (which is fine for browsers and improves caching, but if someone knew the direct image URL, it won’t be human-readable).

**Linking Examples:**
In Markdown (Docusaurus):

```markdown
Check this figure:

![Architecture Diagram](/img/architecture.png)

For details, see [Appendix PDF](/files/Appendix.pdf).
```

During build, Docusaurus will check `/static/img/architecture.png` and `/static/files/Appendix.pdf` exist (or in `public/` if configured). It will transform the Markdown into HTML like:

```html
<img src={require('static/img/architecture.png').default} alt="Architecture Diagram" />
<a href={require('static/files/Appendix.pdf')}>Appendix PDF</a>
```

This ensures the base URL is handled and that a missing file would trigger an error. If using relative paths, the require call will use a relative module path instead. The main point is: **use Markdown syntax for links and images**, not raw `<img>` or `<a>` tags, so that Docusaurus can process them. If you use a raw HTML `<img src="...">`, Docusaurus will leave it as-is (and it won’t adjust base URL or catch missing file issues).

**Edge Cases:** If your docs are going to be translated using Docusaurus i18n, assets co-located in docs have to be duplicated for each language (because each locale has its own docs folder). In that case, using the static folder for images might be easier to avoid duplication. If not translating, this is not a concern.

**Conclusion on Assets:** The conversion script should extract all images from Flare (often Flare outputs them to a resources folder or leaves them as linked files). You’ll then import those into the Docusaurus project. If Flare had an `Images` subfolder with the same hierarchy as topics, you can mirror that. Update the Markdown image references accordingly. As a quick strategy, consider copying all images to `static/img/` and doing a find-replace on the HTML `<img src="...">` to Markdown `![](path)` with the appropriate path. Or for more structure, place images next to their docs and adjust paths. In either case, Docusaurus will be able to serve them. Remember to test that all images appear and files download correctly by running the Docusaurus dev server after conversion.

## 5. Docusaurus Plugin Ecosystem for Automation and Extension

Docusaurus is highly extensible via plugins. In fact, nearly every feature (docs, blog, pages, search) is implemented as a plugin. For someone migrating content, certain plugins can be very helpful, and understanding the ecosystem allows you to plan for future enhancements or automation beyond the initial conversion.

**Core Plugins:** The *docs plugin* (`@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs`) is what provides the documentation functionality. It’s included by default in the classic preset. Similarly, there is a blog plugin for blog support and a pages plugin for static pages. Typically, you won’t need to touch these directly, but it’s good to know they exist. The docs plugin has configuration options for path, route base, sidebar items, versioning, etc. (mostly set via `preset-classic` config in `docusaurus.config.js`).

**Official Plugins:** Docusaurus offers official plugins for things like search (Algolia DocSearch), Google Analytics, sitemap generation, client-side redirects, PWA support, etc. For a documentation migration, two notable ones are:

* **Client-Side Redirects Plugin:** `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects` can generate HTML stub pages to redirect from old URLs to new ones. If your Flare site URLs were different and you want to preserve those incoming links, you can configure this plugin with rules. For example, if Flare had a page at `/Content/Install.htm` and now your Docusaurus page is `/docs/install`, you can set up a redirect from `/Content/Install.htm` to `/docs/install`. The plugin will create an HTML file at the old path that immediately redirects to the new one. This is very useful for not breaking external hyperlinks or bookmarks after migration.
* **Search plugin (Algolia):** If you host publicly and want full-text search, the Algolia DocSearch is integrated via `@docusaurus/theme-search-algolia`. Not directly related to conversion, but good to plan so that once docs are up, they are searchable. If not using Algolia, there’s a community plugin for local search as well.

**Community and Custom Plugins:** The community has many plugins. For example, since you are converting from an external source, one interesting plugin is **docusaurus-plugin-remote-content**. This plugin allows pulling in Markdown content from external repositories or URLs at build time. In theory, one could use it to fetch content from a source and include it. However, in the case of Flare, it’s not directly applicable unless you, say, exported Flare content to a publicly accessible place. More relevant might be writing a custom script to generate files (rather than doing it in a plugin).

**Using a Plugin vs. Preprocessing:** You might wonder if the conversion process itself could be a Docusaurus plugin – for instance, a plugin that reads Flare XML and generates pages. While possible (Docusaurus plugins can generate content before compilation), it is typically easier to perform conversion as a separate build step (using Python or a script) and treat the result as static Markdown input to Docusaurus. The plugin system is more useful once the content is Markdown:

* You could create a Remark or Rehype plugin to handle any special syntax in the Markdown. For example, if some Flare-specific placeholders made it through conversion, a custom Remark plugin could replace or transform them during the Docusaurus build. The Docusaurus config allows adding Remark/rehype plugins in the content pipeline.
* If you needed to integrate dynamic content (like pulling in API documentation from code), there are plugins for OpenAPI docs, GraphQL docs, etc., which might be of interest if your documentation includes those.

**Extending the Docs with MDX Components:** Not exactly a plugin, but Docusaurus allows *theme components* to be swizzled (overridden) and custom React components to be used. For example, if after conversion you find you want a custom UI element to mimic some Flare feature (say an expanding drop-down text), you could implement that as a React component and embed it via MDX. This doesn’t require a plugin, just placing the component in `src/components` and importing it where needed.

**Maintaining and Automating:** Once your docs are on Docusaurus, you can leverage typical web toolchains:

* Use **CI/CD** pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to auto-deploy the site on content changes.
* Use linting tools (we’ll cover in next section) that can be integrated as plugin or as separate scripts.
* If your conversion tool remains in Python, you could integrate it into the build process (e.g., have a script that regenerates the Markdown from Flare source or Flare output whenever needed, then runs Docusaurus build).

**Internationalization Plugin:** If you plan to translate docs (Flare has multilingual output features, and Docusaurus supports i18n), the i18n system is built-in (not an external plugin, but part of core). It generates copies of docs for each locale. This might be an area of extension if you migrate Flare’s multi-language projects – Docusaurus expects you to provide translated Markdown in separate folders or use Crowdin integration.

In summary, Docusaurus’s plugin ecosystem can **aid automation** by providing features that you might otherwise custom-build. Particularly, the redirect plugin helps preserve old links (so you don’t lose SEO or user bookmarks), and community plugins like remote-content or others could be handy for edge cases. The docs plugin itself will do a lot (generate sidebars if needed, handle versioning). Always check the \[Docusaurus Community Plugin Directory] if you have a certain need – for example, there might be a plugin to generate a glossary or index from Markdown, or to embed interactive diagrams, which could replace similar features from Flare.

## 6. Validation and Automation Tools for Converted Markdown

Quality assurance is essential after converting a large documentation set. You want to ensure the Markdown is well-formed, links are correct, and the content adheres to expected standards. Several tools and approaches can help:

**Docusaurus Build Warnings/Errors:** Docusaurus itself will catch certain issues:

* **Broken Links:** If any page contains a link to another doc that Docusaurus cannot resolve (e.g., bad URL or wrong doc ID), the build will error out with a message listing broken links. For example, if `[see here](nonexistent.md)` is in your Markdown but there’s no doc with that id or path, you’ll get a “Docusaurus found broken links” error at build time. This is extremely useful for validation. As a practice, keep the `onBrokenLinks` setting to `throw` (the default) during development, so you catch and fix all broken links. (You can set it to `warn` in production if you need to deploy with known issues, but ideally, resolve them.)
* **Broken Images:** Similar to links, if an image or file is referenced and the file is missing, the webpack require will fail. You’ll see errors during the build (or the dev server console) about missing modules. This ensures you don’t ship pages with missing images—fix any file paths that are wrong.
* **Duplicate IDs:** Docusaurus will warn if two docs end up with the same id (which can happen if you manually set id or if two files have the same name in different folders without a folder prefix). Make sure each doc id is unique; the conversion script can enforce this by, for example, prefixing IDs with a category or using full paths.

By running `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) on the site after conversion, you’ll surface these errors. Even the development server (`npm run start`) might log warnings for some issues, but the production build is stricter.

**Markdown Linting:** Use a linter to catch Markdown style issues:

* **markdownlint** (NodeJS) or its CLI can enforce rules like “no trailing spaces”, “ordered list numbers should increment”, “proper heading levels”, etc. You can adopt a Markdown style guide to keep consistency.
* **remark-lint** (part of the remark toolchain, which Docusaurus already uses under the hood) can be configured with plugins to check for specific patterns. For instance, ensuring that headings are title-cased or checking that all links have text.
* These can be run as part of CI to ensure any manual edits to Markdown don’t introduce formatting issues.

**Link Checkers:** Although Docusaurus catches internal broken links, you might also have external links in your docs. It’s good to run a link checker on the built site or directly on Markdown:

* Tools like **Broken Link Checker** or **blc** (for websites) or **lychee** (a link checker that can parse Markdown) can verify that external URLs return OK. This is more for ongoing maintenance, but worth doing after the conversion because some links might have been carried over from Flare and could be outdated.
* Docusaurus doesn’t automatically check external links; a separate run of a tool or a script is needed for that.

**Spell Checking / Grammar:** When converting, especially if using an automated tool, some odd text artifacts might slip in (for example, if HTML entities weren’t properly handled or if conditional text left some seams). Running a spell checker over the Markdown can catch obvious typos. Tools:

* **Spellcheck GitHub Action**: There are GH Actions that scan for spelling mistakes in the repo.
* **Vale**: A popular “lint” for prose style and terminology. You can set up Vale with a vocabulary (e.g., ensuring product names are spelled correctly, avoiding certain phrases) to maintain consistency similar to how Flare’s condition tags might enforce terminology differences.

**MDX Validation:** MDX is Markdown plus JSX, which is more complex to parse. If your Markdown linter doesn’t understand MDX, it might flag valid MDX syntax as errors. You might integrate **Prettier** (with an MDX plugin) to auto-format and thereby indirectly validate the MDX syntax. Prettier can reformat your docs uniformly (e.g., consistent list indentation, code fence styling), which can catch issues (since if Prettier fails, there might be a syntax problem).

**Unit Testing Content:** In some migrations, teams even write small scripts to verify content conversion. For instance:

* Check that every Flare topic resulted in a Markdown file.
* Check that certain known phrases exist (content not lost).
* If there were Flare micro content or snippets, verify they appear in all the right places in the MD (maybe via searching for unique text).

**Continuous Integration:** Automate these checks:

* Set up a CI pipeline that runs the Docusaurus build (to catch build errors) and runs linters/tests on every pull request or commit. This way, if someone inadvertently breaks a link or format in the Markdown in the future, it’s caught immediately.
* You can also add a step to your CI to run the conversion tool itself (if you treat Flare as the source of truth and want to regenerate Markdown as part of the process). However, in practice once you migrate off Flare, you might stop using Flare and maintain only the Markdown going forward (docs-as-code approach).

**Testing the Site:** After building, do a manual or automated run through the static site:

* Use a headless browser or a tool like Cypress/Selenium to click through links from the homepage to ensure navigation works (this can be scripted by crawling the built site).
* Ensure the search (if configured) indexes the content (usually tested by running the site and using the search bar).

By combining Docusaurus’s own checks (which are quite helpful) with external linting and testing, you can establish a robust quality gate. As a developer of the conversion tool, you might also include a “verify” mode in your tool that logs, for example, how many topics, images, snippets were processed, and if any known construct was not handled (maybe count of "WARNING: unresolved xref" if your tool couldn’t find a target).

**Example – Catching a Broken Link:** Suppose in Flare a topic had a cross-reference to another topic that got renamed or dropped, and your conversion yields `[See XYZ](missing-topic.md)`. When running `npm run build`, Docusaurus will output an error like: *"Error: Docusaurus found broken links! Please check the pages of your site in the list below, and make sure you don't reference any path that does not exist..."*. It will list which page and which link is problematic. This direct feedback pinpoints issues to fix before publishing. You can also configure in docusaurus.config `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` (default) or `'warn'` if you temporarily want to ignore them, but throwing is recommended to not miss anything.

**Final sanity checks:** Validate that the site’s content looks correct:

* Paragraphs aren’t inadvertently combined or broken (could happen if a missing blank line in Markdown – a lint rule can catch that).
* Code blocks render properly (no stray HTML).
* Tables look okay (complex tables from Flare might need adjustment if they were using colspan/rowspan heavily, since GFM tables have limitations).

In essence, treat the docs like code: use linters, automated tests, and CI to ensure the converted Markdown is robust and remains that way with future edits. This “docs as code” philosophy is one reason to migrate to a system like Docusaurus in the first place, and it will pay off in documentation quality.

## 7. Tooling for Converting Flare (XML/HTML) to Markdown

Developing an open-source conversion tool from MadCap Flare to Markdown involves parsing Flare’s output (or source) and converting the structure (TOC, topics, links, media) to a format suitable for Docusaurus. Here we discuss useful libraries and approaches, primarily focusing on Python (as requested) but also noting other options.

### Source of Flare Content

First, decide **what input** your tool will use:

* *Flare-generated HTML/XHTML output*: Flare can produce HTML5 or XHTML files for each topic when you build a target (like an HTML5 Help output). These files have the content after applying conditions and variables, which is very handy – it means you get the final expanded text. Using this as input is straightforward: each HTML file corresponds to a topic. The downsides: you lose some info like topic IDs (though they might be in attributes), and cross-reference links might be in the form of HTML file links (which you’ll need to map).
* *Flare source XML*: Flare’s source topics (.flhtm or .xml) contain proprietary tags (MadCap-specific XML). Directly parsing those would let you potentially extract more semantic info (like snippet references, conditions, etc.), but you would then have to implement logic for applying conditions and variables much like Flare does – a complex task. It might be easier to let Flare do that by generating an output.
* *Flare TOC file*: Flare’s TOC is stored in an .fltoc XML file (or multiple). This gives the hierarchy of topics and their titles as used in the TOC. If available, parsing this will help create the Docusaurus sidebar in the correct order.

A recommended approach is: **Export a Flare target to XHTML** (Flare has a “XHTML” target or you can configure the HTML5 target to produce clean XHTML) and use that as your raw data. Ensure that in the target you select all necessary condition tags and set variables appropriately so the output is exactly what you want in the docs.

### Parsing and Converting HTML to Markdown

Once you have HTML for each topic, the main task is converting HTML markup to Markdown. There are libraries to help:

**Python Libraries:**

* **Beautiful Soup (bs4):** Great for parsing HTML into a tree. You can traverse and manually convert nodes to Markdown text. For example, find all `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags and replace them with `#`...`######` text, convert `<p>` to just text (with two newlines after for paragraph separation), `<strong>` to `**` etc. This gives you fine control, but writing a full HTML-to-Markdown converter from scratch is time-consuming.
* **markdownify / html2markdown:** These libraries do automatic HTML to Markdown conversion. `markdownify` (and its fork `html-to-markdown`) can take an HTML string and return a Markdown string, handling common tags. You can often customize rules. For instance, `html_to_markdown` allows providing custom handling for certain tags (like maybe you want `<img>` to be converted in a particular way). Using such a library can jump-start the conversion. For example:

  ```python
  from html_to_markdown import convert_to_markdown  
  md = convert_to_markdown(html_string)
  ```

  would yield a Markdown text with basic formatting done.
* **Pandoc via pypandoc:** Pandoc is a powerful document converter supporting many formats. Using `pypandoc`, you could convert HTML to GFM Markdown. Pandoc tends to produce very clean Markdown, but you might need to tweak options (e.g., how it handles headings or lists). One advantage: Pandoc could potentially parse Flare’s XML if given a suitable reader, but that’s advanced. Simpler is HTML->Markdown with Pandoc. The downside might be adding a dependency on the Pandoc binary (Haskell-based).
* **Others:** `html2text` (another library) or `Bleach` for sanitizing, etc., but markdownify and html-to-markdown are more focused for this use case.

**Algorithm with Libraries + Custom Rules:**
No converter library will perfectly handle all aspects out-of-the-box, because Flare’s HTML might have some unique patterns:

* *Headings:* Ensure the top-level heading in each topic becomes a first-level Markdown heading (`# Title`). Flare topics often have `<h1>` as the title in the output. The converter should take that text for the Markdown file’s title (frontmatter or first heading). You might even strip the `<h1>` from the content and use it in frontmatter `title`.
* *Lists:* Flare’s HTML for lists is standard `<ul><li>` or `<ol><li>`. Libraries will convert those to `-` or `1.` lists fine. Watch out for nested lists – proper indentation in Markdown is needed.
* *Images:* Flare might output `<img src="Images/img.png" alt="...">`. The converter library might produce `![alt text](Images/img.png)`. You will likely need to adjust the path (e.g., `Images/img.png` might need to become `../static/img/...` or wherever you decide). Possibly post-process image links in the Markdown to point to the right location in Docusaurus.
* *Links (cross-references):* In Flare HTML, links to other topics might be something like `<a href="../Output/Topic.htm">See Topic</a>` or with an anchor. You need to rewrite these to Markdown links pointing to the corresponding MD files. If your conversion maintains a mapping of old filenames to new filenames/IDs, you can replace the href accordingly. For example, if `Topic.htm` became `topic.md` (with id “topic”), you’d output `[See Topic](./topic.md)` or just `(topic)` (if using Docusaurus link by id shorthand, which is not directly supported unless you use `<Link>` component). The simplest is using relative paths that mirror the folder structure of docs.
* *Tables:* HTML tables can be converted to GFM tables by markdownify, but complex tables (with merged cells) might not translate well because GFM doesn’t support row/col span. You might need to detect such cases and perhaps leave them as HTML (which Docusaurus can handle if you allow raw HTML). You could wrap them in an `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` in MDX if needed, but better is to simplify tables if possible.
* *Code snippets:* Flare might output `<pre><code class="language-js">...</code></pre>` for code blocks. The converter should turn those into \`\`\`js fenced blocks. If using a library, verify that it picks up the class as the language identifier. If not, a custom rule may be needed to post-process code blocks.
* *Snippets and conditions:* If you use Flare’s output after conditions and snippet resolution, ideally those are already resolved and you have a static result. But double-check: sometimes Flare leaves markers in the output (like an HTML comment `<!-- snippet: ... -->`). If so, you might remove those via a regex or parser before converting to Markdown. Same with conditions: excluded content won’t be there, included content is just normal HTML.
* *Flare-specific tags:* Flare sometimes adds wrapper `<div>`s or spans with classes (for drop-down text, etc.). For example, expanding text in Flare might be a `<div class="DropDownTitle">...` followed by a hidden `<div class="DropDownBody">...</div>`. Markdown has no direct equivalent, but you could convert that pattern into a Docusaurus `<details><summary>` HTML block or an admonition. The tool may need special-case handling for such interactive content. If such features are heavily used, identify them and decide how to handle (maybe output a note that “feature not converted” or implement a custom markdown syntax for it).
* *Variables:* If the Flare output still contains placeholders (ideally it shouldn’t if output is final), replace them. If the conversion is reading Flare source, you’d need to substitute variables using some input of variable definitions.

**Generating Sidebars:** After converting all topics to Markdown files (saved in some `docs` subfolders), you need to create `sidebars.js` or rely on autogen. If you choose autogen, you might still want to create `_category_.json` files for each folder to set the category label (because the folder name might not be the desired label). For example, if Flare TOC had a node "User Guide" containing topics, you might have put those topics in `docs/UserGuide/*`. By adding a `docs/UserGuide/_category_.json` with `{ "label": "User Guide" }`, the sidebar category will show as "User Guide" instead of "UserGuide" (folder name). You can also set `position` in that JSON to place that category among others.

If you prefer a **single sidebars.js** definition (manual):

* Parse the Flare TOC XML. Each TOC entry has a title and a link to a topic file. You can produce a nested data structure (e.g., a Python list/dict) reflecting that. Then output it as a JS module syntax. Since sidebars.js is just data, you could even output JSON and `module.exports = require('./sidebar.json')` in the JS, but typically one writes directly in JS format.
* Example: if TOC has Book "Guide" with child topics "Intro", "Install", and Book "Reference" with topics "FAQ", you'd produce something akin to the earlier sidebars example with nested categories.
* Ensure that the IDs or paths you reference match the converted docs. If you set custom ids in frontmatter, use those; otherwise use relative paths (which Docusaurus resolves to ids). For instance, if `install.md` has no id frontmatter, its id is "install", so in sidebars you reference `'install'`. If it’s in a subfolder, id is `subfolder/filename`. Keep these consistent.

**Python for sidebars:** You can use **PyYAML** to help if you decide to generate a YAML and then convert to JSON/JS. The GitHub example we saw by *jkonrath* uses a `topic.yml` for a Jekyll TOC. In your case, you might not need YAML; building a Python nested dict and then dumping to JS is fine. You may just write a file with the text content `module.exports = {...};` and insert your data.

**Example Conversion Workflow (Python):**

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from html_to_markdown import convert_to_markdown

# Suppose we have a mapping of Flare HTML file to desired doc path
flare_files = ["Intro.htm", "Install.htm", ...]  # from Flare output
sidebar_structure = []  # will build this as list of items for sidebars

for file in flare_files:
    html = open(file, encoding='utf-8').read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'lxml')
    # Remove or process unwanted elements, e.g., Flare navigation menus, etc.
    main_content = soup.find("div", {"class": "MainBody"}) or soup  # if Flare wraps content
    # Convert main content HTML to Markdown
    md_content = convert_to_markdown(str(main_content))
    # Extract title:
    title = soup.find(['h1','h2'])  # assuming title is the first heading
    title_text = title.get_text() if title else "No Title"
    # Prepare frontmatter
    frontmatter = f"---\ntitle: \"{title_text}\"\n---\n\n"
    md_output = frontmatter + md_content
    # Write to docs folder
    outfile = determine_md_path(file)  # e.g., "docs/Intro.md"
    with open(outfile, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(md_output)
    # Add to sidebar structure (this depends on how determine_md_path works)
    sidebar_structure.append({...})
```

This is a simplified pseudocode, but covers main steps: parse, convert, assemble frontmatter, write file, and accumulate info for sidebar. In practice, you will refine:

* The `determine_md_path(file)` could map Flare file names to nested folders. For example, maybe use the TOC structure: you might have pre-parsed the Flare TOC so you know Intro is top-level, Install is under Guide, etc., and create corresponding directories.
* Use the TOC to decide folder names or to directly build `sidebar_structure`.

**Libraries in Other Languages:**

* **JavaScript/Node:** The equivalent would be using **Turndown** to convert HTML to Markdown. Turndown is a popular JS library for this purpose and is quite configurable. If your tool was in Node, it’d be a top choice. There are also Node libraries to parse XML (Flare’s .fltoc) easily (like xml2js).
* **C#:** Since Flare is a .NET app, one could use .NET to directly manipulate Flare files or outputs. MadCap has an API (and some plugins like the Markdown importer you found), but for an open-source tool, Python/Node have fewer barriers (no need for Flare API or Windows-only dependencies).
* **Pandoc** (Haskell) could be used standalone without Python, but then customizing specific aspects might be harder compared to using a scripting language with a conversion library.

**Testing the Converter:** Ensure to test the converter on a few representative topics:

* A topic with lists, tables, code, images, links to see how they come out.
* Adjust the conversion rules (you might add regex post-processing on the Markdown text if needed for fine tweaks).
* For example, you might find the converter outputs `\*` for some special characters – you can post-process to clean unnecessary escapes or to enforce one sentence per line (if desired by the style guide).

**Performance:** Converting hundreds or thousands of topics is mostly string processing – Python should handle it fine. Libraries like BeautifulSoup can be a bit slow on very large documents, but typically topics aren’t giant. If needed, lxml directly or regex could be faster, but clarity is more important. Writing out Markdown files is straightforward; just be careful with file encoding (UTF-8).

**Sidebar Generation Example:** Suppose the Flare TOC (maybe in XML) looks like:

```xml
<TOC>
  <Topic Title="Introduction" Link="../Content/Intro.htm" />
  <Heading Title="User Guide">
    <Topic Title="Installation" Link="../Content/Install.htm" />
    <Topic Title="Configuration" Link="../Content/Config.htm" />
  </Heading>
</TOC>
```

Your tool would read this and produce sidebars:

```js
module.exports = {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    'intro',   // Introduction
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'User Guide',
      items: ['install', 'config'],
    },
  ],
};
```

Assuming you named the Markdown files `intro.md`, `install.md`, `config.md` and did not override their IDs (so IDs are “intro”, “install”, “config”). If you did put them in subfolders like `UserGuide/install.md`, then the ID is `userguide/install` and sidebar reference should match that.

**Additional Tools:**

* If Flare topics have **Concepts or index** that you want to preserve, you may create an **Glossary** page manually, since Docusaurus doesn’t have an index feature. Perhaps compile all Flare index terms into a Markdown page or ensure search covers it.
* If outputting API documentation (like Flare’s auto-generated API docs), consider using specific plugins (OpenAPI).
* For **validation** of the converted files (beyond Docusaurus build), you could incorporate the above-mentioned linters. There are also HTML to Markdown conversion testing frameworks where you supply input HTML and expected Markdown to ensure the converter does what you expect.

By leveraging these tools and libraries, your conversion workflow can be mostly automated. The heavy lifting (translating markup syntax) can be handled by existing libraries like `html-to-markdown`, while your code focuses on the Flare-specific nuances (TOC structure, special tags, linking, metadata). The result will be a set of Markdown files ready to serve with Docusaurus, plus a generated sidebar configuration.

## 8. Best Practices and Common Challenges in Migration

Converting complex documentation from Flare to Docusaurus is a non-trivial project. Here are some best practices to follow, and pitfalls to watch out for, informed by typical challenges:

**Best Practices:**

* **Plan the Information Architecture:** Decide on the doc hierarchy in Docusaurus *before* converting everything. Often it will mirror the Flare TOC, but you might simplify or reorganize sections during the move. Having a clear mapping of Flare TOC -> Docusaurus sidebar (and thus folder structure) will guide the conversion tool’s design (e.g., how you choose folder names or category labels).
* **Use Meaningful Filenames/IDs:** If Flare topics have IDs or titles that can serve as file names, use those. Clean, lowercase filenames with hyphens or camelCase are common. Avoid spaces or special characters in file names (Docusaurus can handle them, but it’s cleaner not to have URL encodings). This will also make URLs more intuitive (e.g., `getting-started.md` -> `/docs/getting-started`). If Flare file names are numeric or coded, rename them to something meaningful during conversion.
* **Automate Repetitive Replacements:** Flare content might contain lots of cross-reference text like “See *<other topic>*” or placeholders like "{variable}". Automate replacing these with Markdown links or real text. For example, if a cross-reference in Flare was an `<a>` with text "Overview", ensure your converter outputs `[Overview](../intro.md)` or similar. Build a mapping of old filenames to new paths to replace all hrefs systematically.
* **Retain important metadata:** If Flare topics had metadata like author, version, or comments, consider porting some of it to the Markdown (maybe as comments or frontmatter fields). Docusaurus frontmatter is extensible, so you could carry over a “originalFile: XYZ” or “convertedDate: 2025-05-13” if you want traceability. These are optional, but could be useful for auditing the migration.
* **Use Admonitions for Notes/Warnings:** Flare often has styled text for notes, tips, warnings. Instead of just converting them to a blockquote or a colored paragraph, use `:::note` or `:::warning` so they visually stand out in Docusaurus. You might have to detect them (e.g., maybe an icon image or certain CSS class in Flare HTML indicates a Note box). Handling this improves the quality of output docs.
* **Preserve Content Structure:** Ensure that section headings remain correct (Flare might allow non-sequential heading levels; in Markdown, you typically start from `#` per page or `##` if the page title is not shown). Keep the heading hierarchy logical. Docusaurus will automatically build a page ToC from headings H2 and below.
* **Split or Merge Topics if Needed:** Flare topics sometimes are very short or very long. In Docusaurus, you might choose to combine a series of short topics into one Markdown file if it makes sense (or conversely, break a huge page into subpages). This however complicates mapping and link conversion, so do it only if there’s a clear benefit (like easier navigation).
* **Testing after Conversion:** Before declaring success, run the Docusaurus site and navigate every link in the sidebar, glance through pages for formatting issues. It's easier to fix conversion logic and re-run in bulk than to hand-edit hundreds of files later. Look specifically for:

  * Mis-converted tables or images (fix converter and re-run).
  * Odd characters (maybe encoding issues like `â€™` for apostrophe – fix by ensuring UTF-8 and perhaps using an HTML entity decoder).
  * Incomplete content (did something not appear because it was in a Flare snippet not included?).
* **Documentation of the Process:** Ironically, document your own tool and process (maybe in the project README). It will help others (it’s open-source!) and also internal stakeholders to understand how faithful the conversion is and what manual follow-ups might be needed.

**Common Challenges & Pitfalls:**

* **MadCap-specific Features:** Flare has features that Markdown doesn’t directly support:

  * *Conditional text:* As discussed, decide on one output or duplicate content for variants. One forum user noted that an “export to markdown” tool must resolve variables and conditions for a given target. Failing to do so means your Markdown might show leftover conditional markers or half-sentences. Always generate from a fully resolved Flare output (pick a target build).
  * *Snippets and reusables:* If not handled, you might end up with missing pieces (if the snippet wasn’t expanded) or duplicate copies (if you expanded everywhere). Pitfall: double-check that a snippet used in multiple topics has been consistently converted. If you expanded them, it’s fine (just redundant across files). If you attempted to centralize them, ensure all references point to the included component.
  * *Cross-references (xrefs):* Flare xrefs can automatically use the target topic’s title as link text. In your conversion, if you see generic link text or placeholders, you might need to replace it with the actual title. Ideally, use the link text as written in Flare if present. Ensure no links remain pointing to old `.htm` files – those would break. Every such link should now point to a `.md` or MDX (or be an absolute web URL if it was an external link).
* **Lost Styling:** Markdown will not capture styles like font colors, special formatting. If certain visual cues matter (like “text in red means deprecated”), you'll need to represent that differently (maybe an admonition or italic note saying deprecated). Recognize that not everything converts 1:1. Decide what styling is critical to retain and implement a solution (maybe a custom CSS if needed or inline HTML spans with a class).
* **Large TOC vs Single Page:** Flare might produce a single monolithic HTML for PDF output (all topics concatenated). Make sure you’re not accidentally using that; you want individual topics. Docusaurus is optimized for multi-page docs; don’t try to make one giant Markdown file.
* **SEO and URLs:** If preserving URLs (for external users or SEO) is important, list all important Flare URLs and map them to Docusaurus URLs. Use the redirects plugin as mentioned. Pitfall: forgetting a commonly linked page (like `index.htm` or homepage of Flare output). Ensure something in Docusaurus corresponds to it (maybe the Docusaurus site homepage or a docs intro).
* **Attachments and Downloads:** If Flare had attached files or downloadable media, ensure they are copied over and linked. Often these might be PDFs or ZIPs. Put them in `static/` and update links.
* **Performance of site:** If your doc set is huge (hundreds of pages), Docusaurus can handle it, but the build time might increase. You can tune by disabling source maps or using the \[Webpack bar] to monitor. Typically fine, but heads-up if extremely large images or many large code blocks (which can blow up bundle size). Use `docusaurus build --stats` if needed to debug performance.
* **Maintainability:** After conversion, set expectations that future updates will be done in Markdown (unless you plan to regularly re-run the conversion from Flare). It is possible to maintain two sources, but not recommended. Ideally, the docs live in a repository and use a docs-as-code workflow going forward.

**Post-migration Cleanup:** Even with a great conversion tool, some manual cleanup is often needed:

* Fine-tuning wording or structure (maybe Flare content had to be structured a certain way for print, and now you can simplify it).
* Removing any leftover Flare artifacts (like “This topic last updated…” if those were auto-inserted, or Flare-specific navigation text).
* Checking images have appropriate alt text (Flare might have had alt text that came through; ensure it’s present in Markdown image syntax).

Remember the goal: deliver the same or improved content on Docusaurus with minimal friction for users. By following best practices and anticipating the pitfalls above, you can avoid “gotchas” such as missing content due to unresolved conditions or broken links due to mismatched filenames. Testing thoroughly and iterating on the conversion script will yield a high-quality result.

Finally, treat the migration as an opportunity to improve the docs. Docusaurus provides a robust platform – you can now leverage its features (versioning, interactive components, modern site styling). This comprehensive conversion, once done, sets you up with a maintainable, version-controlled documentation system that should serve both developers and users well. Good luck with building the tool and the migration process!
